1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,940
- Project Management.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,500
So, what is project management?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,030
Well, I mentioned that PRINCE2

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,220
is a project-management methodology.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,070
So, we probably should stop and define

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,960
what project management is.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,420
Project management is the practice

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,100
of initiating, planning,
executing, controlling,

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,780
and closing the work of a team

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,410
to achieve specific goals

11
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,770
and meet specific success
criteria at a specific time.

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,740
Now, that sounds like a lot of words

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,430
to explain what is a lot of common sense.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,950
But, having a good
framework and methodology

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,540
for project management is going

16
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,530
to help us and our managers know

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,810
what we should be doing and
when we should be doing it.

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,310
That's really the crux
of project management.

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,170
We're trying to be efficient
in doing our projects

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,550
so we can save time, save
money, and minimize the risk.

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,580
Now, what is a project?

22
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,810
Well, a project is a
temporary organization

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,120
that's created for the purpose

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,660
of delivering one or
more business products

25
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,100
according to an agreed-upon business case.

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,690
We'll talk more about what
a business case is later on.

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,800
But, essentially, the key
thing here with a project,

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,650
that I want you to take
away is the word temporary.

29
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,200
A project is not everlasting.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,690
A project has a defined
beginning and end state.

31
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,160
So, if I'm going to use the example

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,900
of an e-commerce website.

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,080
We may have a project
to build the website.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,730
We're going to have to come
up with the creation of it.

35
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,680
We're going to have to code it.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,800
We're going to have to test it,

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,030
and we're going to have to field it.

38
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,500
But, once we field it and
we open it for business

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,040
for customers to use,

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,880
that need to stop being a project

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,600
and start being an operation.

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,580
So, we're going to
transition this product,

43
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,260
this website, over to
the people who are going

44
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,220
to run it on a daily basis.

45
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,830
Notice, it has a beginning;
and it has an end.

46
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,330
And, that end is defined when we start

47
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,950
back with the agreed-upon business case;

48
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,260
which in this case of a website

49
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,530
may be to provide an e-commerce website

50
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,820
that sells video training courses.

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,653
Right?

52
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:57,150
Once we've done that, we
push it over to operations.

53
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,040
So, keep that in mind.

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,390
A project is temporary.

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,900
So, I think you understand

56
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,940
why project management is important

57
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,270
and what a project is.

58
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,020
But, why should be even use PRINCE2?

59
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,540
Well, PRINCE2 is a
project-management methodology.

60
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,680
It's going to provide
us with best practices

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,710
that have been learned over 30 years,

62
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,710
and we can use to manage
our project using processes.

63
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,250
It can also be combined with things

64
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,400
like the Project Management Professional,

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,280
The IT Infrastructure Library, Agile,

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,570
and many other methodologies
and frameworks.

67
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,290
It is a mature and proven methodology,

68
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,700
and it's going to provide
us with a common lexicon

69
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,080
or terminology that we can
use to discuss our project

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,150
so everyone on the team knows
what we're talking about,

71
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,450
making it easier for us
to accomplish our goal.

72
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,180
Now, when we talk about PRINCE2,

73
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,140
a lot of times people
ask me, "What about PMP?"

74
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,880
because they're both
project-management certifications.

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,160
Well, PRINCE2 focuses on what to do.

76
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,130
PMP focuses on how to do it.

77
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,260
So, while PRINCE2 is a
methodology that uses processes;

78
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,490
PMP is more of a standard
and a knowledge base.

79
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,770
These certifications aren't
actually in competition

80
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,720
with each other.

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,140
Instead, they can be used with each other

82
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,220
to give you even more benefit.

83
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,400
Now, if you're thinking,

84
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,360
should I get my PRINCE2 certification

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,300
or my PMP certification;

86
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,770
one of the things that draws
a lot of people to PRINCE2

87
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,090
over PMP is that it doesn't have

88
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,720
the educational experience requirement.

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,830
So, with PMP, before you
can even take the exam,

90
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,430
you have to prove that
you have 4,000 hours

91
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,150
of working on projects.

92
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,210
With PRINCE2, that doesn't exist.

93
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,460
Instead, they have the
foundation-level certification

94
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,293
where you're going to be able

95
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,510
to get some of that experience,

96
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,600
get on to a team, and start working.

97
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,060
And, then you can move up into a PMP.

98
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,237
So, if you're brand new
to project management,

99
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:48,203
PRINCE2 is a great place to start.

100
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,350
Now, what are some other
benefits of PRINCE2?

101
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,210
Well, like I already
mentioned, it gives you

102
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,290
this common dictionary of terms

103
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,430
for those who are involved in the project.

104
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,160
It also is going to
explicitly state the roles

105
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,230
assigned for each responsibility.

106
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,220
And, we'll talk about that

107
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,220
in the defining roles and
responsibility section.

108
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,860
It's also very customer-focused by design.

109
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,310
PRINCE2 assumes that there

110
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,100
is a customer-supplier relationship.

111
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,630
Now, that doesn't mean
that if the customer

112
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,030
is outside of your
organization necessarily.

113
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,500
For example, I work in the IT field.

114
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,840
I am a supplier to everyone
else in the organization.

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,130
I provide them servers.

116
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,450
I provide them databases.

117
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,310
I provide them all different services.

118
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,480
I am the supplier in that relationship.

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,370
And, my customer may be
in sales, or marketing,

120
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,390
or accounting.

121
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,570
It doesn't really matter what
department I'm servicing;

122
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm still being the service
provider or the supplier

123
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,410
in that case.

124
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,880
PRINCE2 also provides us with
a lot of repeatable processes.

125
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,810
In fact, there are seven processes

126
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,640
that we're going to talk about in PRINCE2

127
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,800
that every project has to go through.

128
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,480
And, if we do it the same way every time,

129
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,223
it becomes very predictable,
and it can reduce our risk.

130
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,330
PRINCE2 also delivers on business needs

131
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,430
because it's very product-based.

132
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,020
It's focused on what the result is.

133
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,970
So, we want to make
sure that, if the result

134
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,420
is we're going to build a website,

135
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,550
then, at the end of this
project, we have a website

136
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,820
that's ready to go and it's
delivered to our customer.

137
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,750
Right?

138
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,290
And, the last thing, is it
adaptable and tailorable

139
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,190
to both the business and
the size of the project?

140
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,580
And, so PRINCE2 has a lot
of benefits for us to use.

141
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,471
But, there's a couple of things
that it won't provide you.

142
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:28,380
PRINCE2 does not talk
about specialized aspects

143
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,380
of the business.

144
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,213
So, we're not going to talk

145
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,090
about acquisition and procurement.

146
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,560
We're not going to talk
about legal, or financial,

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,910
or human resources.

148
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,180
Because, all of those
things are specialized

149
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,790
to your organization;
and they won't be covered

150
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,000
in the generic PRINCE2 framework.

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,830
Instead, PRINCE2 is going to leave that

152
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,840
up to your organization
to decide what's best.

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,650
It also excludes the management of people.

154
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,840
Now, that may seem weird,

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,980
if you come from a
project-management background.

156
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,720
Because PMP is very focused on management

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,430
of people, and timelines,
and Gantt charts,

158
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,150
and all of that type of stuff.

159
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,680
But, PRINCE2 doesn't worry about that.

160
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,310
Instead, it focuses on the
products and the processes

161
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,130
to make sure things get done.

162
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,720
They leave the management of people

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,570
up to your organization
and the way you organize.

164
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,680
And, it also doesn't
focus on the techniques

165
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,870
or dictate how to do something.

166
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,780
So, for example, PRINCE2 says
you need a business case;

167
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,630
but it doesn't tell you
how you have to write it.

168
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,110
That's left up to you.

169
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,880
Instead, it's more focused on
the process and the products,

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,730
the fact that you have a business case;

171
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,760
and that business case is
used throughout the process.

172
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,840
Another example is PRINCE2 says you have

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,670
to have a requirement document,

174
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,640
but it doesn't say how to create it,

175
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,670
who you need to talk to
to get it coordinated.

176
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,190
Again, all of that is stuff

177
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,750
that your organization
