1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,890
- Risk.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,090
So, the next theme we're
going to talk about is risk

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,570
and when we concern ourself
with the risk theme,

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,170
we're thinking about how
we can identify, assess

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,290
and control uncertainty
and improve the ability

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,870
of the project to be successful overall.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,970
Because in everything
we do, there is risk.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,240
Now, what exactly is risk?

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,780
Well, risk is an uncertain event

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,580
which will have an effect
on the project's objectives

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,830
and that objective is to produce
the final product, right?

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,320
And so when we look at this,

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,392
we have to consider two
major pieces of this risk,

14
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:36,381
the uncertain event piece.

15
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:39,930
That means the event may or may not occur.

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,260
When we're dealing with
risk, it is uncertain.

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,100
We don't know if it's going to happen.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,910
If it does happen, then
it may become an issue.

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,530
But until it does, it's
just this uncertain future

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,510
that's out there.

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,350
It may or may not happen.

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,090
There's a risk that when
I go to work tomorrow,

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,690
I could get hit by a car.

24
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,610
That may or may not happen, right?

25
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,670
That's what we're talking
about here, this risk.

26
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,960
And the second piece is the effect.

27
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,200
Now most of us think
of risk as negatively.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,930
There's a negative effect that can happen,

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,170
like I could get hit by a car tomorrow

30
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,091
but there's also positive risk.

31
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,960
What if I found $20 on the street?

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,130
There's a risk that may happen

33
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,240
and I'll get $20 extra, right?

34
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,000
There is positive and
negative risk out there.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,820
And we'll talk about that as
we go through this lesson.

36
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,720
Now, risk is not a project issue.

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,810
And what I mean by that

38
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,270
is that there are these
things called project issues.

39
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,600
These are an event that have happened

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,300
and they weren't planned for.

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,701
So if I was building a house

42
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:37,070
and someone was laying tile in my bathroom

43
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,632
and I hired them to lay that tile

44
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,350
and they brought the wrong tile

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,170
and laid it all out and spent two days

46
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,312
of work putting the new
tile in the bathroom,

47
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,470
that would be a bad thing, right?

48
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,670
That's an issue.

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,460
There was a risk they would
have brought the wrong tile,

50
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,930
and in this case, that risk was realized.

51
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,670
That turned into a project issue

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,620
and now we need to rip out
all that tile and redo it

53
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,410
and it's going to cost us
more time and more money.

54
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,868
Risk, on the other hand,
is this uncertain event

55
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,380
that is in the future.

56
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,370
It may or may not happen,
as we just talked about.

57
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,400
And when a risk occurs, it
could become a project issue.

58
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,940
Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not.

59
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,410
If there was risk that we had
an additional customer load,

60
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,280
where more customers bought
our product than we expected,

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
that may not be a bad thing

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,860
and so it wouldn't be a project issue.

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,457
But if too many people,

64
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,410
and there was millions of people

65
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,350
who came to our website
that we're building,

66
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,730
and we weren't expecting that,

67
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,610
that could actually crash our server.

68
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,160
And so too much acceptance of our product

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,880
could be a bad thing as well.

70
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,020
And so you really have to weigh this thing

71
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,620
and think about the risk

72
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,120
and what you can do to minimize the risk

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,460
and have a positive
impact for you overall.

74
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,910
Now, when we look at this, we
talk about realizing the risk.

75
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,885
And realizing the risk
is when the risk happens.

76
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:54,970
There are threats and
there are opportunities.

77
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,730
Now those negative things
we're talking about,

78
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,320
those are all threats.

79
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,380
And those threats is when risk is realized

80
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,100
through a negative impact.

81
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,450
Something bad happens.

82
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,200
We installed the wrong tile.

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,730
We crashed our server.

84
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,680
There was a vulnerability that was found.

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,750
All those things are threats.

86
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,150
But we also have opportunities

87
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,970
and these are the good things that happen.

88
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,170
This is when risk is realized
with a positive impact.

89
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,720
So, I thought I was only going

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,270
to get 100 customers the
first day but I got a 150.

91
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,530
It was enough that I could
handle the extra load

92
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,200
but I made a bunch of extra money.

93
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,570
That's a good thing.

94
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,320
Now, if I had 100,000 show up on day one,

95
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,760
that may become a threat cause
it could crash the server.

96
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,320
And so you can see how these
risks could go positively

97
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,840
or could go negatively.

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,010
And it really depends
on how you handle them

99
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,110
and how your project is
setup to handle these risks.

100
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,840
And that takes us to this
concept of a risk budget.

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,220
When you're building out your
financials for your project

102
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,740
and how much it's going to cost,

103
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,420
you should have a dedicated pot of money

104
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,330
that's used to fund any risk responses.

105
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,340
That's called the risk budget.

106
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,450
Going back to the house building example,

107
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,780
if the project manager
didn't catch the tile

108
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,130
before it was installed,

109
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,468
they would now have to
pay to take out the tile,

110
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:08,610
to buy new tile and to install that tile.

111
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,700
Those three things may
cost them another $1,000.

112
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,630
That would come from the risk budget

113
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,510
because it wasn't planned
and that risk was realized.

114
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,520
The guy put in the wrong tile.

115
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,030
Now, how much risk
you're willing to accept

116
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,030
is really a question
for your organization.

117
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,420
And we measure this in something
called the risk appetite.

118
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,280
Some organizations are very risk adverse

119
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,608
and they will not take any risk at all

120
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,548
or take very minimal risk.

121
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,690
Other organizations
will take a lot of risk

122
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,720
and they have a very high risk tolerance

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,470
or high risk appetite.

124
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,620
Now, that risk tolerance is
the threshold that is set

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,940
that cannot be exceeded without
an exception being written

126
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,550
in the exception report.

127
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,780
Now again, depending on your organization,

128
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,710
they may be more or less risk adverse.

129
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,702
And the way you overcome
some of that adverse risk

130
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:58,630
is that you start planning for it

131
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,250
and you come up with mitigations

132
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,500
to bring the risk level down.

133
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,250
Other organizations will
just accept the risk

134
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,770
and they'll just say that's
the cost of doing business.

135
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,038
These are the things that your
organization's going to have

136
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,290
to determine and you're
going to have to live within

137
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,210
those frameworks and that risk tolerance.

138
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,290
Now, how is your project
going to deal with risk?

139
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,260
Well, that's where the risk
management approach comes in.

140
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,440
And this is a written outline
of your risk management

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,350
and it is required as you
initiate your project.

142
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,610
There's going to be a document

143
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,640
called the risk management approach.

144
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,060
It will tell you what
your risk tolerance is,

145
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,610
how much budget you're going to have

146
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,049
and how you're going to deal
with risks that come up.

147
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:38,630
All of your risks should be identified

148
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,830
in what's called the risk register

149
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,690
which is a document or a journal

150
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,660
that the project manager's going to own.

151
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,130
This is going to document every
single risk in the project

152
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,910
and it's going to be used
by the project manager

153
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,380
to capture these risks

154
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,010
and notate how they're
going to handle those risks

155
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,520
if they are realized and become an event.

156
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,130
Now, as a project manager

157
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,689
or someone working on the project,

158
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,030
you're going to have to deal with risk.

159
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,040
And the way we do that is
through a five step procedure.

160
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,930
We identify the risk, we assess the risk,

161
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,750
we plan for the risk, we
implement our risk mitigations

162
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,300
and then we communicate those risks upward

163
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,660
to either the project manager
or up to the project board.

164
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,530
So when we deal with identifying it,

165
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,770
these are where we're going to list out

166
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,720
our threats and opportunities.

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,460
We're going to describe them
in terms of their source,

168
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,270
the event or the area of uncertainty

169
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,520
that may happen and the effect or impact.

170
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,440
Being able to identify all those things

171
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,540
that might go wrong or
possibly could go right,

172
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,030
that are risky for us, is
a really important step.

173
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,000
Then, we're going to take that
list of all of those risks

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,910
and we're going to assess them.

175
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,640
We're going to estimate the probability

176
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,900
or the likelihood, the
impact, the proximity,

177
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,200
when it's likely to occur,

178
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,220
and evaluate all the net overall effect

179
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,980
of all of these risks.

180
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,700
So if you're building a house
or an apartment building,

181
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,880
there are lots of bad
things that can happen

182
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,840
and lots of good things that can happen.

183
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,080
We're going to list all those out

184
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,990
and assess which ones are
most likely to happen.

185
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,410
Is it very likely that someone

186
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,186
is going to install the wrong fixtures?

187
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:10,520
Probably.

188
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,750
Is it very likely or less
likely that the house

189
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,510
will burn down during construction?

190
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,880
Probably less likely.

191
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,890
And as we go through all of these things,

192
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,840
we're going to figure out how we can plan

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,480
for those risks, starting
with the most likely

194
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,820
and moving our way down
to the least likely.

195
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,160
And that brings us into
our planning stage.

196
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,770
When we plan, we're going
to curve for one or more

197
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,260
of those specific risks

198
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,320
and figure out what our responses may be.

199
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,930
So now that we've planned,
we have to implement that

200
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,630
and this is where we're
going to take action

201
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,620
in response to our chosen risk.

202
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,960
So we're going to pick one
of those risks from the list,

203
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,430
we've assessed it and we
planned a counter measure to it,

204
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,650
something to mitigate it.

205
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,630
Now, we're going to implement it.

206
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,100
So let's take the example

207
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,500
of your installing a new
work station into a network.

208
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,743
It's a very small project.

209
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:57,000
There's risk associated with that though

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,040
because as you install
that new workstation,

211
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,920
you might be bringing in
additional vulnerabilities.

212
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,786
Well, one of your mitigations may be

213
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:06,170
to institute a vulnerability
management program

214
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,500
and scan those workstations
before they're installed.

215
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,700
This is a mitigation to lower your risk

216
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,750
that you're going to be
bringing into your network.

217
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,420
And you're going to do this
by assigning a risk owner

218
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,270
who's going to be be
responsible for managing

219
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,000
this vulnerability management program,

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,612
this risk of bringing in the new machines,

221
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,710
and a risk actionee

222
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,650
who is going to carry
out the risk response,

223
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,200
the person who's going to run
those vulnerability scans.

224
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,810
So you can see how you have this risk,

225
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,930
you have this mitigation,

226
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,700
and somebody who's
responsible for both of those.

227
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,570
Next, we're going to look at communicate.

228
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,590
And this is where we
want to report the status

229
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,890
of the risk up to your shareholders

230
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,850
using your PRINCE2 reports,

231
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,950
such as your Highlight reports
or your Exception reports.

232
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,972
So if there was a risk
and it was realized,

233
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:50,231
you better communicate that
up and what you did about it.

234
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,350
Or, if there's some big risk

235
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,560
and you think you need more
money to your risk budget

236
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,172
to be able to put in implementations

237
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:58,060
and mitigations for it,

238
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,520
then again, you're going to
have to communicate that up.

239
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,520
And if it's outside your
budget and your tolerance,

240
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,040
it's going to be an exception.

241
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,460
If it's within your tolerance
and within your budget,

242
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,300
it would just be inside
your Highlight report.

243
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,630
Now as we go forward, we
can talk about the two types

244
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,130
of risk responses.

245
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,900
We have responses to threats

246
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,290
and we have responses to opportunities.

247
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,900
Remember, threats are
those negative things.

248
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,330
When we look at risk, we can avoid it.

249
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,570
We can reduce it.

250
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,610
We can accept it.

251
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,260
We can transfer it.

252
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,230
We can share it.

253
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,530
And we can prepare contingency
plans to deal with it.

254
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,530
Now, when we look at the positive side,

255
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,850
we can exploit it.

256
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,940
We can enhance it.

257
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,470
We can reject it.

258
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,620
We can transfer it.

259
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,530
We can share it

260
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,300
and we can prepare our contingency plans.

261
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,230
Now, wait a minute.

262
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,310
The last three in both of
those columns are the same.

263
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,143
That's right.

264
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:49,250
And this makes it really easy on test day.

265
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,134
So you just need to remember

266
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:53,260
what are the threats and the opportunities

267
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,660
and look at them of what is different.

268
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,880
Because they may give you a question

269
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,980
that says something like

270
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,200
what is not an appropriate
risk response to threats?

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,140
And then they'll say something like

272
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,880
avoid, reduce, accept,
transfer, share and reject.

273
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,847
You go, "Ah, wait a minute.

274
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,700
"Reject is an opportunity."

275
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,640
we're not going to do that
inside of threats, right?

276
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,440
And so you can look at those.

277
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,230
Now, when you look at
these risk responses,

278
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,073
this is the way you're going
to address the primary risk.

279
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:19,270
But even after you
address the primary risk,

280
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,310
there is some residual risk left over

281
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,660
and that should also
receive a risk response too.

282
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,524
So if I was going back to my example

283
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:30,011
of the workstation being
installed on the network,

284
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:32,540
we're going to do
vulnerability management on it.

285
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,210
That should catch all
known vulnerabilities.

286
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,560
That mitigates down our risk to a low

287
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,910
because there are still
zero days out there

288
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,340
that vulnerability
management will not find.

289
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,121
Now what are you going to
do about those zero days?

290
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:47,000
Most people have learned to accept those

291
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,900
or they transfer it by buying some sort

292
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,231
of hacker or cyber insurance.

293
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:53,760
Some people will avoid it
by unplugging the device

294
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,270
from the network, right?

295
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,370
There's all sorts of responses you can do

296
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,020
but remember, there is residual risk

297
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,680
and you have to deal with that too.

298
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,090
And you're never going to
get your risk down to zero.

299
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,710
So you're going to have to, at some point,

300
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,650
either avoid it, transfer it,

301
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,140
reduce it, share it, accept it,

302
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,550
something from that threats column

303
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,430
or from the opportunities column,

304
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,840
depending on if it's a
negative or a positive risk.

305
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Now, in PRINCE2 for the risk theme,

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,290
there are a couple of
things you just have to do.

307
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,790
The first is you have to define

308
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,400
your risk management approach

309
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,380
by describing your risk
management procedures to be used.

310
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,920
And this is done in your risk
management approach document.

311
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,937
You're also going to
maintain a risk register

312
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,025
to record and manage your risk.

313
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,944
You're then going to have to identify,

314
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:40,950
assess, manage and review your
risks throughout the project

315
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,170
because they change over time.

316
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,930
There is schedule slip risks.

317
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,167
There is over budget risk.

318
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,670
And the closer you get to
the end of the project,

319
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,020
the less likely that's going to happen.

320
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,390
Earlier in the project,
it's more likely to happen

321
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,600
because there's so many more variables.

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,450
You're also going to
need to define your roles

323
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,690
and responsibilities for risk management.

324
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,745
Going back to that principle,

325
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:03,185
and again, we want to use lessons learned

326
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,890
to help inform our risk decisions.

327
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,670
If you've only built one house,

328
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,680
it's a pretty risky process.

329
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,060
But if you built 100 of
that same floor plan,

330
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,490
that same house, it becomes less risky

331
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,040
because you have experience
and you know what you're doing.

332
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,284
This all is going to
factor into your risk,

333
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:20,660
into your risk budget

334
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,453
and into your risk tolerance
for a given project.
