1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,740
- Manage by exception.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,900
The manage by exception principle asks

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,900
one fundamental question:

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,360
how can we manage this
project more efficiently?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,220
Well, one of the ways that we do that is

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,230
by using manage by exception,

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,330
and that is going to allow
only significant deviations

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,320
from a budget or an approved plan

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,580
to be brought to the
attention of management.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,640
That's right, senior
management doesn't want to know

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,060
the day-to-day progress of the project.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,310
Instead, they leave that
to the project manager

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,770
and the way they do this is
through using tolerances.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,350
So because projects are so fluid,

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,090
they know that change is going to happen.

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,300
I'm going to budget $10,000 for this stage

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,990
but it may cost 9,000; it may cost 11,000

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,910
because changes happen.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,710
How are we going to deal with that change?

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,340
Do I need to go back to the project board

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,260
every time there's going to be an issue?

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,140
Well no, instead by
using manage by exception

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,550
each project is going to
have tolerances built into it

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,570
for each project objective,

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,370
and delegated authorities
down to the project manager

26
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,870
for them to deal with it.

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,570
So in the case of this stage, say a cost

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,620
which is one of those project objectives,

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,857
if we have cost and we
say the cost is up to

30
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:17,890
$10,000 for this stage, and
you have a 10% tolerance,

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,790
that means you can spend
between 10 and $11,000.

32
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,880
If I forecast that this project
is going to cost $12,000

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,560
well now I need to go
talk to the project board

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,320
because I'm outside the
tolerance they gave me.

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,540
This allows project managers
to handle more of the issues

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,850
without having to involve senior managers

37
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,610
or the project board, and it
eliminates a ton of meetings

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,980
which makes us more efficient.

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,740
So, how do we do that?

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,140
Well as a project manager
I am going to submit

41
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,030
a highlight report, and the
highlight report is used

42
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,270
to keep the project board informed about

43
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,640
the progress of the project.

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,100
If a tolerance for the stage
is forecast to be exceeded

45
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,680
then I have to create an exception report

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,700
and send that to the project board.

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,560
So in the example of this stage and cost,

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,170
we said this stage is
allowed to cost $10,000

49
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,050
plus 10% tolerance.

50
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,300
So if I now forecast that
it's going to cost me 15,000

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,560
that's a 50% higher than I was allotted.

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,610
I need to put that into
an exception report,

53
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,780
tell the project board, and
ask either for more money

54
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,490
or some sort of a change.

55
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,260
That change may be to
relax some requirements

56
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,860
so that I can spend less money.

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,870
Or it may be to give me more money

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,350
so I can meet the requirements they want.

59
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,020
Everything is going to be a balancing act

60
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,560
between time and quality and cost,

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,760
and we'll talk more about
that as we go forward.

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,370
But for right now, I just
want you to understand

63
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,780
the concept of these tolerances.

64
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,280
For each of the objectives
we have a tolerance set,

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,720
and that may be something
that's don't go above

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,030
this amount of money, or don't go below

67
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,950
this amount of performance, right?

68
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,460
And we'll talk about
that as we go through.

69
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,900
The project objectives
we're talking about here

70
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,000
is time, and cost, and quality, and scope,

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,970
and benefits, and risk.

72
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,220
Each of these have to be balanced

73
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,390
and they're all set in the
initial initiation stage

74
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,550
for that program initiation documentation.

75
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,530
When I look at that PID it's going to say

76
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,770
this project must be completed in X time,

77
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,330
let's say six months.

78
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,760
If I think that I'm not
going to meet the six months,

79
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,910
I'm going to raise that as an exception.

80
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,150
Now with a highlight report,

81
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,190
I also can tell them good things.

82
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,280
I thought it was going to
cost me $10,000 for this stage

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
but I was able to do it for 5,000

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,090
and I saved you some money.

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,230
Quality, we need to have a
99% uptime on this network.

86
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,540
Well, am I meeting that or am I not?

87
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,870
What's my tolerance?

88
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,770
Same thing with scope, benefits, and risk.

89
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,390
All of these are things
that are those levers

90
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,140
that the project board uses
to control the project for us.

91
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,510
Now tolerances can be
set three different ways

92
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,940
and they get started by the
program or corporate management

93
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,910
when they approve the project plan.

94
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,340
They say for the project
level, the overall,

95
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,890
there's a certain amount of tolerance.

96
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,110
Let's say that they say
the project level tolerance

97
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,080
is 10% of cost.

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,930
This is going to be a
million dollar project

99
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,570
and I will allow a 10% variation.

100
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,880
Now the stage is going to be recommended

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,860
by the project manager and
approved by the project board.

102
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,790
Now if I was on the project board

103
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,060
and I knew I had a 10% tolerance,

104
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,980
that means I'm probably going
to give the project manager

105
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,640
something like a five or a 6% tolerance

106
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,820
so I have room to control if
he starts going out of bounds.

107
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,550
Then the project manager
can actually set tolerances

108
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,740
for his teams below him
in the work packages.

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,540
These are approved by the project manager

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,640
and usually if he has
a five or 6% tolerance

111
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,330
he might only give his
teams a one or 2% tolerance

112
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,130
because again, every time
a tolerance is exceeded

113
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,370
the next layer up is going to
have to deal with that change.

114
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,180
So if the team exceeds a tolerance

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,550
on the work package
level, the project manager

116
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,760
can still fix it before it flashes up

117
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,370
and goes all the way
up to the project level

118
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,890
which then has to go all the way up to

119
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,820
corporate and program management.

120
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,497
So you can see how
these things nestle down

121
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:13,550
and we try to keep them down
at the lowest level possible

122
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,160
so we can keep progress moving forward.

123
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,650
So what are some benefits
of management by exception?

124
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,930
Well, it allows senior
management to focus on strategy

125
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,510
without getting overburdened
by daily decisions

126
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,910
of the project.

127
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,390
So for example here, you see a Navy ship,

128
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,120
it's out and about doing its mission.

129
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,950
The Chief of Naval
Operations who's sitting

130
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,030
in Washington D.C. is
not telling that ship

131
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,070
to turn left or to turn right.

132
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,457
Instead, he gives them a plan and he says,

133
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:46,200
"I want you to go from
California to Australia."

134
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,940
Then it's up to the ship to figure out

135
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,220
how they're going to get
from one place to the other

136
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,610
because they've delegated that down.

137
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,630
So that's up to them to figure that out.

138
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,190
Now on the ship there's a
captain who is in charge

139
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,160
and he doesn't want to
be up 24 hours a day

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,170
seven days a week, so he delegates down

141
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,290
some of that as well.

142
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,077
So he might say, "Okay, for the next day

143
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:06,437
"I want to get from point A to point B.

144
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:08,760
"Navigator, figure that out."

145
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,490
Then the navigator can figure that out

146
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,980
and he'll give it to the watch teams

147
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,107
and he'll say, "Okay, you
go from point A to here

148
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,727
"and then the next team
will take it from there

149
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:17,880
"to the next point,"

150
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,290
and you get the idea, right?

151
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,290
They keep breaking it down
into smaller and smaller chunks

152
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,280
and as long as they stay
within the tolerances

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,290
nobody has to report back to
the guy in Washington D.C.

154
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,410
to say we got there or we didn't.

155
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,690
That's all they have to report,
we did it, or we didn't,

156
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,050
or we went too far out of bounds.

157
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,220
That's the idea here.

158
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,620
It becomes an efficient use
of senior management's time.

159
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,420
There are no regular progress meetings

160
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,020
because we have these highlight reports

161
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,770
and these exception reports,

162
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,950
and there's no in-between
meetings that are happening

163
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,960
between the project manager
and the project board.

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,580
Now that is according to PRINCE2

165
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,100
but your organization may be different.

166
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,770
I've worked in a lot of organizations

167
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,430
where they love their
weekly progress meetings.

168
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,850
So everybody sits around
a table for an hour

169
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,397
on a Monday morning and says,

170
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:03,910
"Here's what we're doing this week,"

171
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,447
and then on Friday they
all come back and say,

172
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,270
"Here's what we finished this week,"

173
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,960
and it's really a waste of time.

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,490
But if they use that
management by exception,

175
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,780
those meetings can be eliminated

176
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,760
so it really is crucial.

177
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,080
So how do you really do
management by exception well?

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,320
Provide good tolerances for your people

179
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,390
and empower them to make decisions

180
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,340
to stay within those tolerances.

181
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,076
If you can do that, you will
have a very successful project.
