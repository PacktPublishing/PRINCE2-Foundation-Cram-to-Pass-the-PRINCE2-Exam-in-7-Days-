1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,350
- Change, the next thing we're
going to talk about is change,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,140
and change is going to
help us identify, assess,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,160
and control any potential
or approved changes

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,260
to our project baseline.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,560
So let's talk about a
baseline a little bit here.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,770
A baseline is used only for products

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,200
that have been approved
by those in authority

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,770
and is deemed fit for purpose.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,500
It's something that is finished,

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,210
it's ready for the next iteration.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,620
The product has been
given a version number.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,350
So if you're dealing
with a software project,

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,970
we often call it version
one, version 1.1, version 2.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,220
Version 2, and we have these minor changes

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,850
and these major changes.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,140
But any time you change the baseline

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,990
going from version 1.0 to the next thing

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,280
you have to go through the change theme

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
and the change management procedures.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,580
Now when we look at a project

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,700
there are lots of issues that come up.

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,350
In fact, we just talked
about in the risk lecture

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,540
all of those risks that
can become realized

24
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,770
and turn into a project issue.

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,200
When you have a project issue,

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,670
this is an event that has
happened and wasn't planned for.

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,610
This is going to require some
sort of management action

28
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,330
to overcome it and move
the project forward.

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,650
So this can be a request for change

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,800
where we request a change
to the known baseline.

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,310
We want to go from version
one to version 1.1.

32
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,460
Or it may be that we need
an off-specification.

33
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,890
This is going to allow
the product requirements

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,360
to be changed because we can't
meet the ones as designed.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
When I talked before about
the iPhone drop example

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,040
if we couldn't drop it from two feet

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,900
we may do an off-specification
to allow us to do it

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,910
as a drop from one foot.

39
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,430
Then we have problems or concerns.

40
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,460
This is the third type, this is anything

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,600
that's outside of an RFC
or an off-specification.

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,730
Now if the project issue
will exceed a tolerance

43
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,500
then we have to go through
the exception report,

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,150
through the exception process

45
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,460
that the project manager
is responsible for

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,450
to inform the project board

47
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,930
because any time you're
going to go outside tolerance

48
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,810
the project board needs to be notified.

49
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,240
Now, the resolution of
these project issues

50
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,050
can happen one of two ways.

51
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,420
There is a formal process
and an informal process.

52
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,500
The formal process is going
to require formal advice

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,130
from the project board.

54
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,090
So we put it in our exception report,

55
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,940
the project issue is logged
in the issue register,

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,410
and an issue report is
written by the project manager

57
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,440
and submitted to the project board.

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,550
They can then go through and decide

59
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,100
are we going to make a change,

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,110
are we going to do an off-specification,

61
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,420
or are we going to accept the way it is?

62
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Now informal is the easier
way of doing things,

63
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,130
and this is when the issue is recorded

64
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,010
inside the daily log.

65
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,360
The reason it's easier is
because the project manager

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,320
can deal with it at their own level.

67
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,860
This is something they
don't have to bring up

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,440
to higher management,
they have enough funds,

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,760
they have enough tolerance,
and they can deal with it

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,950
and solve the problem themself.

71
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,220
So when it's informal
they're just going to note it

72
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,740
in their notebook, take care
of the issue, and move on.

73
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,930
Now, the change control
approach is going to depend on

74
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,620
the way you decided to set it
up inside of your project.

75
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,640
You're documenting the
way that the project

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,460
is going to manage these
issues and changes.

77
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,570
How is that change control going to work?

78
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,850
Who is the change authority?

79
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,080
And what is this process
going to look like?

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,580
You're going to have issue
and change control procedures

81
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,220
that provide detailed steps
that you're going to utilize

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,650
inside your project.

83
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,150
Now again, PRINCE2 isn't going to dictate

84
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,490
how you have to do this change process.

85
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,990
Instead, it just says you have to have

86
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,650
a change control process,

87
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,100
and that's why you need to
make sure you document it

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,940
in your change control approach

89
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,910
in case you ever get audited.

90
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,610
Now, when you look at this issue

91
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,760
and change control procedures,
there are five main steps

92
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,900
but again, you're going to
put the detailed processes

93
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,790
in your project yourself.

94
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,490
You have to capture,
examine, propose, decide,

95
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,750
and implement those changes.

96
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,910
Now when you want to capture the change,

97
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,690
this is where you're
going to record the issue

98
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,650
in either your daily
log if you're doing it

99
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,640
informally as a project manager,

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,180
or formally inside the issue register.

101
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,420
Next, you're going to examine that change.

102
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,460
You're going to perform an impact analysis

103
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,420
to determine the impact on your cost,

104
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,350
your time, your quality, your scope,

105
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,320
your benefits, and your risk.

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,840
All of these factors are
things you need to consider

107
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,370
because every time you make a change,

108
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,740
it's going to affect this.

109
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,250
It may take more time

110
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,020
or it's going to take more
money to take less time,

111
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,460
or you're going to drop
quality to save some money.

112
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,580
All of these are levers
that have to be moved

113
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,270
in order to make sure your project

114
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,120
gets to its angle on the
right time, the right budget,

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,040
the right schedule, to
be deemed successful.

116
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,420
The third step is to propose the change

117
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,940
and this is where you're
going to consider your

118
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,550
alternative options for
responding to the project issue.

119
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,050
There are always more than
one way to solve a problem.

120
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,060
You may have an issue, for example,

121
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,660
in building out a network.

122
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,890
Maybe your routers didn't arrive on time.

123
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,040
Well how are you going
to get back on schedule?

124
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,700
Well, maybe you're going
to spend more money

125
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,530
to expedite the shipping
and get it here faster.

126
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,840
Or maybe you're going to
choose a different vendor.

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Or maybe you're going to let
the schedule slip by a week

128
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,790
and you're going to
deliver it a week late.

129
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,700
These are all things you can decide,

130
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,940
but again you have to
propose the way ahead

131
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,660
and what are your courses
of action going to be?

132
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,530
Then next you have to decide.

133
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,460
You're going to determine the best option

134
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,870
for the best overall value for the money.

135
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,810
Now remember, overall value for the money

136
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,750
does not mean cheapest.

137
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,930
You may accept a higher
price for higher quality,

138
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,840
or a higher price for a shorter time.

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,790
That is totally acceptable.

140
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,160
It depends on what your
goal of your product

141
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,950
and your project is.

142
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,440
And finally you have to
implement that change.

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,100
Now that you've decided what to do,

144
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,730
you need to perform the
recommended course of action

145
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,310
or option to solve your issue.

146
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,460
That gets you past this change issue

147
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,490
to move on to the future.

148
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,480
Now, how do you approve changes?

149
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,200
Well, approval for changes
come from the change authority.

150
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,290
If you remember back in
our organization theme,

151
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,870
I showed you the different diagrams,

152
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,820
the change authority was
shown off to the side.

153
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,010
Now they are the ones
who are going to review

154
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,450
and they're going to approve
your request for change

155
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,330
or your off-specifications.

156
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,630
This can be performed by the
project board by default,

157
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,500
but in larger projects
they're actually going to

158
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,170
delegate that down to somebody else

159
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,830
who is going to work outside
of the project manager

160
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,250
to be that change control process.

161
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,810
Now inside of that person,
that change authority,

162
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,880
that role, there is a change
budget allocated to them.

163
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,150
Just like we had a risk
budget to deal with

164
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,200
those risk mitigations,
we have a change budget

165
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,280
which is a special budget that's set aside

166
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,840
to fund any approved changes.

167
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,420
Now here's where you have to be careful

168
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,370
as a project manager,
because often people try to

169
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,950
steal from the risk budget for a change,

170
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,017
or they try to steal from
the change budget for a risk.

171
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,260
So you want to make
sure you're being honest

172
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,470
when you're choosing which pile of money

173
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,960
that you're going to be using,
depending on if it really is

174
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,750
a risk mitigation, or if it's
a change to the baseline.

175
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,540
Now all of this kind of
comes together inside of

176
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,090
what we call configuration management.

177
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,560
This is where your project
needs to be able to identify

178
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,270
different versions of the
product or products that it has.

179
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,510
This is really easy inside of software

180
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,150
because we're used to
using versioning control.

181
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,020
So we have version one of the software,

182
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,553
version 1.1, version 1.2.

183
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:21,600
But if you're doing something like

184
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,320
building an apartment building,

185
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,080
people don't often version
control their projects that way

186
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,490
but they should according to PRINCE2.

187
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,200
So once you get to that approved baseline,

188
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,360
that's the way it was built,

189
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,000
that's what we call the as-built,

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,270
and anything after that becomes a change

191
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,600
that must go through
configuration management.

192
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,350
If I wanted to move the
wall from here to there

193
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,600
that should go through a change process.

194
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,300
Now the configuration
item record is a document

195
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,340
that is is going to record
the status and version

196
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,630
of a given product.

197
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,780
This can be a paper item
like in a card catalog

198
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,980
or it can be in an electronic database.

199
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,340
Now another part of your
configuration management

200
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,440
is something called the
product status account.

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,580
This is a report that
contains the status of

202
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,570
one or more products.

203
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,400
So again, if I'm dealing
with a big piece of software,

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,670
I may have five or 10 different functions

205
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,990
that are being built
separately as products.

206
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,620
So each of those, I need
to know the status of it.

207
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,350
Has it been approved or is
it still being worked on?

208
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,210
This is useful for the product manager

209
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,410
to determine if the product was approved

210
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,200
and has a baseline version,
or if it's still undergoing

211
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,270
its quality control or development.

212
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,030
The product status account
is that master list

213
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,910
that lets me know where every
piece of this puzzle is,

214
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,050
and what the status is of it.

215
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,980
Now, when we get to PRINCE2
minimum requirements for change

216
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,550
there are four main ones
we have to consider.

217
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,100
First, we have to define
a change control approach

218
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,540
to describe our issue and
change control procedures used.

219
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,660
Again, PRINCE2 doesn't
care how you do issue

220
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,610
and change control, but the
fact is you have to do it.

221
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,310
Next, we want to maintain
an issue register

222
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,190
for formal changes, or a daily
log for our informal changes

223
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,750
to record and manage all
of our project issues

224
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,000
that happen along the way.

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,950
Then we want to define our
roles and responsibilities

226
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,870
for change management because again,

227
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,140
if you don't have well-defined
roles and responsibilities

228
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,030
like who is the change authority?

229
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,850
Who can approve use of the change budget?

230
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,610
Those are things that need to be defined.

231
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,110
If you don't have that,
you're going to falter.

232
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,470
Then we also want to look
at our lessons learned

233
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,010
from past experiences so we can apply them

234
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,480
into our change decisions moving forward.

235
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,360
Because maybe the last time we did this

236
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,940
we decided that our change
was to spend more money

237
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,100
to expedite shipping, but
that made us go over budget

238
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,430
and we weren't successful
in the project anyway,

239
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,110
and we fell behind on time schedule.

240
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,880
So maybe we want to take a
different route this time.

241
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
Those are the type of things you can learn

242
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,933
from lessons learned
and previous experience.

243
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:52,814
