1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,730
- The seven processes.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,110
So, up to this point,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,630
we've talked about PRINCE2

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,670
and we've talked about the
principles and the themes,

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,470
but now, we're going to
dig into the processes.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,480
This is really where we start applying all

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,470
of those principles
and all of those themes

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,400
to really make sure our project

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,170
is going to go off without any issues.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,430
Now, the seven processes
are going to describe

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,980
which role from the
project management team

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,960
is responsible for making decisions

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,000
when decisions need to be made,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,350
and when should those decisions be made.

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,180
So, this could be from the executive,

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,500
the senior user, the senior supplier,

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,370
the change authority, or the
project manager themself.

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,030
Each of those are going to be responsible

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,800
for certain decisions
throughout the processes,

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,940
and we're going to talk about that

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,560
as we dig through these.

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,040
Now, when we talk about
the seven processes,

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,490
we start with starting up a project.

24
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,610
Then, we move into directing a project,

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,550
initiating a project,
managing a stage boundary,

26
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,370
controlling a stage,
managing product delivery,

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,540
and finally, wrapping up
and closing a project.

28
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,350
As we move through the cycle,

29
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,170
you'll see that these
are much more sequential,

30
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,650
as opposed to our
principles and our themes,

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,900
which could be applied at any time.

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,120
Now, when we're dealing with processes,

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,090
it's really important
to consider them in time

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,820
because these things are going to happen,

35
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,870
some of them together, but
many of them are sequential,

36
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,610
one after the other.

37
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,880
So, here on the screen, you
can see my process timeline.

38
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,410
This is a really handy chart

39
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,140
and one I recommend you
print out and learn.

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,130
Now, you can see across the top,

41
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,890
I have Pre-Project, Initiation Stage,

42
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,350
Subsequent Stages, the Final Stage,

43
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,840
and Post-Project.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,170
And you can see that
we start out with this,

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,060
providing the project mandate.

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,660
Then, it goes into
starting up the project.

47
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,430
Next, we have the initiation stage,

48
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,040
and that's going to be
initiating the project,

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,930
managing a stage boundary,
and directing a project.

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,240
In the subsequent stages,

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,900
we have a lot of those same things,

52
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,410
but we add controlling a stage

53
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,220
and managing product delivery.

54
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,130
And then, we have our final stage,

55
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,180
where we are going to control the stage,

56
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,070
manage project delivery, and
ultimately close the project.

57
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,830
Now, we're going to talk
about each of these blocks

58
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,070
and each of these processes

59
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,110
as we go through these next seven lessons,

60
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,580
so stick with me.

61
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,003
We're going to learn
all about the processes.
