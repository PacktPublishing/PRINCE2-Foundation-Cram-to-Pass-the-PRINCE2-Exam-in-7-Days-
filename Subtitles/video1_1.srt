1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,500
- Welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,640
What is this course all about?

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,810
Well, this course is all about

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,230
the PRINCE2 Foundation certification.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,150
This course is not going to give you

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,270
an in-depth guide to PRINCE2,

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,660
but instead we're going to review

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,280
all of the main concepts

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,660
so you can take and pass
the exam with confidence.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,814
This course is going to cover
the frequently asked concepts

11
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:26,860
and it's going to help you
focus your study efforts

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,620
to the things you need to know

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,860
to be able to pass the
Foundation level exam.

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,480
Now, who am I?

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,480
My name is Jason Dion, I'm a
professor and an instructor.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,490
I've been working in
the cybersecurity field

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,330
for about two decades and I
have led and been a part of

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,930
many many projects through that time.

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,040
I've dealt with projects in
the Information Technology

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,950
space as well as in the
Cybersecurity space.

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,390
I've dealt with small projects

22
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,160
of just a couple of thousand dollars,

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,930
all the way up to large projects

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,280
costing several million dollars.

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,600
As we go through this course,

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,630
I'm going to bring out lots of examples

27
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,450
to help you understand
the PRINCE2 methodology

28
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,662
and how that fits inside
a project management.

29
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:10,640
Before we get started, I
have a couple of pieces

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,100
of important information
I want to share with you.

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,900
First, this course is closed captioned,

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,960
so if you need to follow along
with the English captions,

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
you can click on the CC
button on your video player

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,420
and you'll be able to
follow along that way.

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,310
Second, sometimes I get
excited about this stuff

36
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,300
and I start speaking too fast,

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,293
or for some students, they
think I speak too slow.

38
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,850
In either case, the player does allow you

39
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,150
to speed me up or slow me down

40
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,520
by clicking on the 1X button.

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,940
Go ahead and click on that button

42
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,550
and you can increase the
speed by going to 1.5 or two,

43
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,550
or you can decrease the speed
by going down to 0.5 or 0.75.

44
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,700
Also, every slide you see in this course

45
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,220
you can download as a PDF file.

46
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,540
Attached to this lecture
you're going to find

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,560
a downloadable resource
that has all of the slides

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,470
in one convenient download,

49
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,050
so you can print it off
or put it on your Ipad

50
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,660
or your tablet and take it
with you for offline studying.

51
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,680
And finally, if you have a question,

52
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,470
please feel free to post
it in the Q & A section,

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,500

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,500
and interact with me
and your fellow students

56
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,790

or other certifications.

57
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,380
And one final disclaimer
before we get started.

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,019
I want to remind you that PRINCE2, ITIL,

59
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,540
ITIL v3, ITIL Foundations,

60
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,350
and the Information Technology
Infrastructure Library

61
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,990

62
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,910

countries around the world.

63
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,830
I don't own those terms, I'm
just teaching you the concepts

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,690
so that you can pass the
PRINCE2 Foundation exam,

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,183
so let's get started.
