1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,440
- Managing product delivery.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,530
This process is focused
on controlling the link

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,280
between the project manager
and the team manager

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,870
or team managers

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,200
by agreeing to the
requirements for acceptance,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,330
execution, and delivery
of certain products.

7
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,210
The role of a team manager is
to coordinate an area of work

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,810
that will deliver one or more
of the project's products.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,140
So if we go back to my house example,

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,920
I might have the plumbing.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,360
That's one team manager.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,350
I have electrical, that's another.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,670
I have the air conditioning,
that's another.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,210
And each of these people are responsible

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,990
for certain products being delivered

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,790
in the final build of this home.

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,220
Now, when we look at this
on the process timeline,

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,820
you will see it falls right underneath

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,550
the controlling a stage

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,020
and that's because a project
manager is responsible

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,460
for controlling the stage,

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,660
breaking up the work into work packages,

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,790
and pushing that down to the team managers

24
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,030
at managing product delivery.

25
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,180
And so when we look at this,

26
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,650
we have a couple of key objectives.

27
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,050
We have to ensure work on products is

28
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,880
allocated to the teams.

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,830
Because if the project manager
doesn't approve any work,

30
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,260
nothing's going to get done.

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,040
And the project manager is responsible

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,570
for authorizing that work

33
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,030
through the form of work
packages or team plans.

34
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,440
They're also going to ensure
the team managers and suppliers

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,030
are clear as to what is expected of them

36
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,010
in terms of the cost,
the schedule, the time,

37
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,250
and the effort for a given product.

38
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,990
Going back to our house example,

39
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,280
how quickly do you need that plumbing run?

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,330
Well, I expect a three-bedroom,
two-bath house to be run

41
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,660
in two days,

42
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,400
and it's going to cost a thousand dollars,

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,690
or whatever that time
and scope is in cost,

44
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,470
you need to agree to that.

45
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,520
You also need to ensure that
your products are delivered

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,840
within tolerance.

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,490
So if you have a tolerance of two days,

48
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,310
plus or minus one day, they
can deliver it anywhere

49
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,510
between one day and three days, right?

50
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,340
Because that's within your tolerances.

51
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,770
Again, you're going to want
to keep tighter tolerances

52
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,480
on your teams, than you,
as a project manager,

53
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,550
have been given, so you have some room

54
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,030
to deal with the issues
if they exceed them.

55
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,960
And then you want to ensure
accurate progress information

56
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,980
is being provided to the project manager

57
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,650
at agreed upon frequencies
from those team managers.

58
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,100
And we'll talk about how they do that

59
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,400
with the checkpoint reports.

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Now, what do I do if my
supplier doesn't use PRINCE2?

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,750
Because, in all honesty, most
suppliers don't use PRINCE2.

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,920
PRINCE2 is used by project
management professionals.

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,530
It's not used by suppliers
most of the time.

64
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,630
Managing product delivery
acts as this interface

65
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,950
between PRINCE2 and the supplier.

66
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,730
Because your supplier doesn't
necessarily need to operate

67
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,120
inside of PRINCE2, instead,
they need to be able to operate

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,730
within the bounds of the
work package you give them,

69
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,440
and those work packages are
going to serve as this interface.

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,380
To convert things from the project plan

71
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,070
down to the stage plan,

72
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,060
into this little piece
called a work package

73
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,200
that is authorized by the project manager

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,580
and fits nicely into this
PRINCE2 architecture.

75
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,300
Now, when we look at a work package,

76
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,770
this is going to provide your team manager

77
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,360
the tolerance they need

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,140
that is required for
their product delivery.

79
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,430
This is set by your project manager

80
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,160
when you're dealing with the work package

81
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,180
or team plan level.

82
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,240
Team managers may be
required to make a team plan,

83
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,420
which is authorized by the project manager

84
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,210
or the senior supplier.

85
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,020
Senior suppliers will handle this

86
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,280
for any outside vendors and contracts.

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,550
So if I was going to
be buying a whole bunch

88
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,390
of computers to get installed,

89
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,540
that would be handled
by the senior supplier.

90
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,690
If I was going to run a
bunch of network cable

91
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,890
and we already owned it all,

92
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,910
I just had to do it with my IT staff,

93
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,950
that would be something that
would be handled internally

94
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,280
by me as the team manager
or by the project manager,

95
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,210
depending on how your
organization is set up.

96
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,580
Now, when we deal with checkpoint reports,

97
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,250
this is the method that
the team manager uses

98
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,110
to provide accurate updates
and progress reports

99
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,880
up to the project manager.

100
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,070
They'll usually talk about their schedule

101
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,750
and their cost at this point.

102
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,870
This is similar to a highlight report,

103
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,440
but at this lower level
that manages the team plan

104
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,270
or the work package.

105
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,490
Team managers should raise a project issue

106
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,080
to the project manager any time

107
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,610
that a work package or team plan tolerance

108
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,200
may be forecasted to be exceeded.

109
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,080
So if you think you're going
to go outside the bounds

110
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,300
of what the project manager has given you,

111
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,920
you better tell them.

112
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,340
Now, a team manager does not have to write

113
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,840
an exception report.

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,240
That's not their role.

115
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,850
They're going to tell the project manager,

116
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,880
and the project manager,

117
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,050
if it's going to go outside
their bounds, will write

118
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,910
the exception report up
to the project board.

119
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,987
(electric blips)
