1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:03,789
- Progress, our last theme
is the progress theme.

2
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,837
And when we deal with the progress theme,

3
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:08,067
we're worried about
establishing the mechanisms

4
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:10,893
to monitor and compare
the actual achievements

5
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,600
against those that we plan for.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,331
We want to provide a forecast
for the project's objectives

7
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:17,944
and the projects continued viability

8
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:21,753
as well as controlling any
unacceptable deviations.

9
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:24,376
Now, that's a big, big ask.

10
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,456
Now what does all that really mean?

11
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:30,323
Well, it means we want to put
into place controls to monitor

12
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:33,526
and compare what's actually
happened on the project

13
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:36,227
versus what we thought
should happen on the project

14
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:38,808
and we also want to look out
into the future to decide

15
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,005
is the rest of the project still on track

16
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,503
and are we going to be successful?

17
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,031
So how do we do all of that?

18
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,594
Well, we're going to use some
effective progress controls.

19
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,727
The first is to delegate authority

20
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:53,511
from one level of management
downward to the next

21
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,218
and let people deal with the issues

22
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:57,106
at the lowest level possible.

23
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:59,986
We're also going to divide
the project up into stages

24
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:02,450
and authorize them one at a time,

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,127
giving us that go-no-go decision point

26
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:07,452
as we move through the project.

27
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:09,202
We're also going to have time-driven

28
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,257
or event-driven progress
reports and reviews.

29
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:14,428
Again, feeding back to those stages

30
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,380
and feeding back to those
products that we expect

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,876
to get those go-no-go decisions

32
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:21,127
and we're also going to raise exceptions

33
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:23,207
when things aren't going properly

34
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:25,394
because if you're not
raising the exceptions,

35
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:27,378
then it's hard for people above you

36
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,223
to delegate authority down to you,

37
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,260
going back to that first point.

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,319
Now, all of these project controls

39
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,138
should be documented inside
your Project Initiation Document

40
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,452
because this PID is going to tell you

41
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:42,524
what is going to occur
throughout the whole project

42
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:45,415
and the way you're going
to conduct your business.

43
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,834
Now, tolerances are
another important control.

44
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,540
In fact, they are probably one of

45
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,898
the most important controls that's used

46
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,127
inside an effective
PRINCE2 project.

47
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:58,167
This is your permissible
deviation from a plan

48
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:01,602
before you have to bring it up
to the next higher authority

49
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,023
and so those exceptions are cruded

50
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,210
based on exceeding tolerances.

51
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,586
So let's start at the bottom.

52
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,068
Let's say you're a team manager

53
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,252
and you're working on a
work package or a team plan,

54
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:15,239
you are given tolerances
from the project manager.

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,007
Now, if they gave you a 2% tolerance

56
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:21,547
and you exceed that, you
will give a project issue

57
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:25,751
to the project manager to say
"I exceeded the tolerance."

58
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:28,578
Now, let's say that that went up to them

59
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:32,055
and they looked at it and
their tolerance was 3%,

60
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,580
they would give them by the project board

61
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,780
because stage tolerances are
set by the project board.

62
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,148
If we have now exceeded
that stage tolerance,

63
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:42,530
the project manager has to
create an exception report

64
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,762
and push that up to the
project board to deal with.

65
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:48,492
Now the project board has
their own set of tolerances

66
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,807
and if we exceed those
project level tolerances,

67
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,175
then they have to put an exception report

68
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,767
up to the corporate or program management

69
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:59,372
because they're the ones who
set the project tolerances.

70
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:02,231
And so again, the
lowest, tightest controls

71
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,447
should be down at the work package.

72
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:05,740
Those mid-grade controls or tolerances

73
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,916
should be at the stage tolerances

74
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,412
and then the widest controls or tolerances

75
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,695
should be at the project level

76
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,998
because as you go up the chain,

77
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,815
you have more responsibility
and more authority

78
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,639
and that's the way that
we can control things

79
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,452
using our tolerances.

80
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:24,258
Now, there are two types
of progress controls

81
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,091
that I mentioned.

82
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,671
There are time-driven and
event-driven controls.

83
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,372
Time-driven controls are useful
for monitoring and reporting

84
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:33,644
on time-driven issues.

85
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,671
They're going to occur
at a regular frequency,

86
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:37,730
whatever that is that you've agreed to.

87
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,738
So for example, maybe your
higher reports are submitted

88
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,839
every two weeks up to the project board.

89
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,268
If that's what you've agreed to,

90
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,370
that is a time-driven control.

91
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,300
Now, if you look at event-driven controls,

92
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,322
these are where you control a
project using a certain event.

93
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:55,586
This occurs when there's a
specific thing that happens.

94
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:58,882
So, maybe we're going to lay
the foundation of a house

95
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,652
and then we're going to report that.

96
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,498
Maybe it's when we get the drywall up,

97
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:03,820
we'll then report that.

98
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,146
Maybe it's when an exception has happened,

99
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,703
then we're going to have to report that

100
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:09,111
and create an exception report.

101
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:12,034
These are all examples
of event-driven controls.

102
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,231
So, time is based off the calendar,

103
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,015
event-driven are based
off something that happens

104
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,583
driving us to report it.

105
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,751
Now, inside of the progress theme

106
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,748
there are lots of different
documents we're going to use.

107
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:27,831
The first is the work
package, or the team plan.

108
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:30,124
This is authorized by a project manager

109
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,524
before work can actually start.

110
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,658
Next, we have a lessons log

111
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,418
and this is where the lessons learned

112
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,274
are going to be captured
as they're learned

113
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,332
any time we do a review.

114
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:43,010
That review may come up as
part of an in-stage report

115
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,295
or an in-progress report
or some other forum.

116
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,066
Next, we have a lessons report

117
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,764
and the lessons report is
going to be a collection

118
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:52,332
of these lessons from the log

119
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:55,458
and they're going to aid in
our future forecast inaccuracy.

120
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,570
So, if we see that we
are constantly behind

121
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,500
every time we use x-vendor,

122
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,749
maybe we don't want to
use x-vendor anymore.

123
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:05,495
Next, we have the end stage report

124
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:07,991
and this is a report that is
written at the end of the stage

125
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,711
to allow that go-no-go decision

126
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,228
to be made by the project board.

127
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:15,031
This is conducted at
the end of every stage

128
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,570
and it will give us
whether or not the project

129
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,692
is assessed as being viable

130
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:23,415
to continue if it still
has a valid business case.

131
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:26,530
And then finally, we have
the end project report.

132
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,916
After you're done with the entire project

133
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,946
and all the stages, you have
to close out this project

134
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:33,602
and to do that we're going
to use an end project report.

135
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:37,079
It's conducted at the end to
evaluate the project as a whole

136
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,490
and evaluate whether or not
we can close the project

137
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,762
and if there's any outstanding items.

138
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:43,959
We'll talk more about
the end project report

139
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,124
when we talk about closing a project

140
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,525
when we get to the processes.

141
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,263
Next, let's talk about our controls

142
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,517
that are used by our project manager.

143
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:55,095
They're going to use
controls to create baselines.

144
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,260
These controls are things
like the project plan,

145
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,786
the stage plan, the exception
plan and the work package

146
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:03,255
Because by creating that first product,

147
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,410
they create that first baseline.

148
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,482
Next, we want to talk about how
they can review the progress.

149
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,700
Well, they can review
how the project is going

150
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,666
by looking at the issue
register, the risk register,

151
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,642
the quality register, the
product status account

152
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,103
or the daily log.

153
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:20,759
All of these help them know
what the current status

154
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,394
and progress of this project is.

155
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:25,900
Next, they have to
capture and report lessons

156
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,874
and they do that using the lessons log

157
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,790
and the lessons report.

158
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,852
And finally, they have to report progress

159
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:34,493
and this is done using checkpoint reports,

160
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,631
the highlight report, the end stage report

161
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:39,246
and the end of project report.

162
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:41,079
All of these are different controls

163
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,532
that the project manager
uses to keep their thumb

164
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,839
on the pulse of this project
as they move forward.

165
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,290
Now, when we look

166
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,092
at the minimum requirements
for this theme,

167
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:51,831
there are just a couple of them.

168
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:55,628
We have to define the projects
approach to control progress.

169
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,754
How are we going to make sure
we progress through the stages?

170
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:03,148
We also need to create our
Project Initiation Document

171
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,311
because that is a key document

172
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:06,796
for us to be able to measure
our progress against.

173
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,802
Next, we need to manage by stages

174
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,586
and manage by exception using tolerances.

175
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,892
Both of these were key
principles that we had

176
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,001
that are being implemented
through this theme.

177
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:20,204
Then, we have to review the business case

178
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,223
whenever an exception is raised.

179
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:23,980
This is important because
we want to make sure

180
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,487
that the project remains viable.

181
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,642
It's still going to meet the used case

182
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,444
and it's still going to get
the benefits for the customer

183
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:32,151
at the price, time and quality

184
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,436
and all those factors that
we promised and agreed upon.

185
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,943
And finally, again, we want to learn

186
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,831
from previous lessons in the project

187
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:42,274
and this is really important
inside the progress area

188
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:44,034
because in the progress theme,

189
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,783
we're capturing a lot of those lessons

190
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:49,283
in the lessons report and the lessons log.
