1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
- The seven themes.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,610
So what are themes?

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,030
Well themes are these areas of
project management that must

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,340
be addressed continuously
throughout the project.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,190
Whether we're initiating the project,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,150
performing the project,
or closing out the project

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,840
we still need to address
these seven themes.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,880
Now these themes are based
upon the seven principles.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,680
So you can see on the screen
where I have the seven

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,560
principles below and then
on top of that we stack

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,160
these seven themes.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,630
These themes are then going
to be applied inside of our

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,550
processes that we're going
to get to in the next section

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,920
of PRINCE2.

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,630
But before we go there we've
got to cover the themes.

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,060
And in this section we're
going to cover each of the

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,440
seven themes.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
Those seven themes are the business case,

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,320
organization, quality, plans,
risk, change, and progress.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,913
So let's go ahead and
dive into the themes.
