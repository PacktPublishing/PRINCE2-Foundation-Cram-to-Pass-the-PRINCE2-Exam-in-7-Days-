1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,710
- Manage By Stage.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,910
The next principle we have
is called Manage By Stage.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,810
What this asks the question of,

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,100
is how far out can I realistically plan?

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,030
What do I mean by that?

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,470
When I look at a really
big, large project,

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,470
I'm going to have some high-level plan

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,000
that covers the whole project.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,150
On the screen you'll see a
map from Baltimore, Maryland

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,590
all the way down to
Disneyland in California.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,450
This is a pretty big road trip
if you wanted to drive it.

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,890
It's three or four thousand
miles, essentially.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,760
That's going to take us
five, six, or seven days

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,910
and I'm not going to be able to
know what the traffic is like

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,080
if I look today along that entire route

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,090
because it's going to
change on a daily basis.

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,680
Instead, I should have a detailed plan

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,630
that is added stage by stage.

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,750
In my road trip example, maybe
I go and plan a day at a time

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,710
and I can look at Google
Maps in the morning

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,100
and see what the traffic
patterns are like that day.

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,260
When I get to day two,
I might start driving

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,540
and be leaving Columbus, Ohio.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,820
I can zoom in and see
what the traffic's like

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,160
between Columbus, Ohio
and Springfield, Illinois,

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,670
just for an example.

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,750
That's a detailed stage plan and

28
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,900
I might be able to figure out, okay,

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,870
I'm going to stop for gas here,
I'm going to get lunch here,

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,220
and make it much, much more detailed

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,130
than if I tried to plan
the entire 3500 mile trip

32
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,190
all at once before I even got in the car.

33
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,150
The same thing holds true
inside of our projects.

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,910
We want to manage by stages

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,680
because it's more
accurate to plan that way.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,740
We can agree on the detail

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,653
for each stage at each stage break.

38
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,110
How much is it going to
cost for the next stage?

39
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,910
How long is it going to
take for the next stage?

40
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,280
Maybe I'm going to say, you
know what, the next two days,

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,160
we're going to be driving through
some really expensive places

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,890
and it's going to cost
me $300 a day for food.

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,870
But then I'm going to go
to some inexpensive places,

44
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,170
it only costs me $100 a day for food.

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,430
And so we can plan that, stage by stage,

46
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,463
just like we can inside of our projects.

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,500
When we look at this,
you have to ask yourself,

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,010
how many stages do you need?

49
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,520
In PRINCE2, you need to have
a minimum of two stages.

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,870
You must have an initiation stage,

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,550
which is used to plan the overall project,

52
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,310
that large, not detailed map.

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,740
And then you need to
have a delivery stage,

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,690
or multiple delivery stages,

55
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,530
that are used to deliver
the specialized projects

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,360
and those are those detailed stage plans.

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,710
In my example of the road trip,

58
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,840
I would have the
initiation stage that plans

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,610
the overall route, from
Baltimore to California.

60
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,200
And then I would have delivery
stages of one day each,

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,750
so six stages, that
would plan out the detail

62
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,050
of where we're stopping,
what hotel we're staying at,

63
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,640
what food we're going to
get, et cetera, et cetera.

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,690
You get the idea.

65
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,090
And before we can leave that stage,

66
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,600
ie, go to sleep up for the night
and pick up the next stage,

67
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,730
we have to have the next
stage planned and ready to go.

68
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,920
The same thing applies
inside of our projects.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,740
This all comes down to the concept

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,320
of what's called a planning horizon.

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,950
Your plan can only be made to a manageable

72
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,890
level of detail based on the timeline.

73
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,260
If I'm planning out something

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,210
that's going to take a week to build,

75
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,330
I can probably do that in two stages,

76
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,930
an initiation stage and a
building or delivery stage.

77
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,610
But if I want to do something
that's going to take nine months,

78
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,930
that may need to have two
or three or four stages.

79
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,530
For example, I built my
house that I'm sitting in.

80
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,930
Well, I didn't build it,
the contractors built.

81
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,460
But when they built out the plan,

82
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,710
we came up with a nine month plan

83
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,650
of what would happen for
us to build this house.

84
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,590
And then, there were
breakpoints along the way

85
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,000
where they stopped and said,

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,200
have we met everything
in this particular stage?

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,560
Okay, we're going to close that stage

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,590
and move to the next stage.

89
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,840
PRINCE2 recommends three levels of plans.

90
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,490
They have a project plan, a stage plan,

91
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,870
and an optional team plan.

92
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,120
Project plans are not very detailed.

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,280
They're very big and very broad.

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,330
They're going to give things
like time and overall cost

95
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,000
and that's going to be
developed by the project board.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,920
The stage plan is built
by the project manager

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,600
and they're going to be more detailed.

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,830
And then the team plan is going
to be very, very detailed.

99
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,930
If I look at the example of my house,

100
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,900
one of the teams was the plumbers.

101
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,970
They only had a plan that covered

102
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,020
putting in the plumbing in the house.

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,140
But the project manager had a stage plan

104
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,960
that included putting in the plumbing,

105
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,540
the heating and cooling,

106
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,600
putting in the wiring for the
electrical, and the drywall.

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,670
All of that was in one stage.

108
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,380
And then the project plan
itself was the overarching plan

109
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,100
that the project board, the
executive, I, had, which was,

110
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,860
I want a finished house
to go from the ground

111
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,530
all the way through to a
house that I could live in.

112
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,690
You can see how this breaks down

113
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,030
from the bigger to the
smaller to the very small.

114
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,803
Each one has more detail than the last.

115
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,300
The initiation stage is going to ensure

116
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,120
all your costs and your
timescales are considered

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,410
before you even start the project.

118
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,870
These aren't going to be exact.

119
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,547
It's not going to say, that this
is going to cost me $1,997.23.

120
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,550
It will say, this project will cost me

121
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,700
about two to three thousand dollars,

122
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,780
something generic like that.

123
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,550
You're going to create,
in the initiation stage,

124
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,770
a thing called the Project
Initiation Documentation, or PID.

125
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,690
This is produced inside
the initiation stage.

126
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,440
The project board uses
the PID to determine

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,200
the project's viability to
continue to the next stage.

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,530
It gives them, what are the
things we must accomplish

129
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,610
before we go to the next stage?

130
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,010
It's going to have that
for all of the stages

131
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,500
for the entire project plan in this PID.

132
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,303
It's going to be that
overview and that outline.

133
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,550
Moving from the initiation stage,

134
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,770
we go into those delivery stages.

135
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,430
Before we move from one stage to the next,

136
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,420
we always have a go/no go decision.

137
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,440
This is where we ask,

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,860
should we move forward with the project?

139
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,550
This is going to minimize our risk

140
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,750
by providing cancellation points.

141
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,810
Let's use the example of the road trip.

142
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,490
Let's say we got on the
road and we planned six days

143
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,293
to drive from Baltimore,
Maryland to California.

144
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,750
We go with the first day,
and we get to the hotel,

145
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,570
and we thought it was going
to take us eight hours,

146
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,440
but it really took us 10
hours because of traffic.

147
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,400
Then we assess.

148
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,270
Will we still be able to make
it to California on time?

149
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,620
Yes or no?

150
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,460
Do we even still want to go to California?

151
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,300
Yes or no?

152
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,940
And then we'll keep going.

153
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,180
We finish that stage, we
go into the second stage.

154
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,930
We go to day two and we
drive through day two

155
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,470
and it took us 18 hours cause
there was really bad traffic.

156
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,360
Now we're in Columbus,
Ohio, and we're looking out,

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,790
we're going, man, for
us to get to California,

158
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,570
it may not be worth it any more.

159
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,030
Let's turn around and go home.

160
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,260
And that's our no go decision.

161
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,380
We don't want to go to the next stage.

162
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,450
We just decide to back
out or cancel the project.

163
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,330
That's the same thing that
happens with our projects.

164
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,120
Every time we hit the end of a stage,

165
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,900
the project manager is going
to update the project plan

166
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,220
with what the forecast was
and what the actual was.

167
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,617
Maybe we thought it was going to cost

168
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:08,100
$10,000 to do this project
and we start looking

169
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,680
at the end of the stage and
we already spent $12,000.

170
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,700
That would be a bad thing, right.

171
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,630
We already blew the entire budget.

172
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,420
The managers might say, you know what,

173
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,670
we're done, this project's over.

174
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,850
These are the kind of things you have to

175
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,560
look at at the end of the stage.

176
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,290
You look at what you
think it was going to cost

177
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,400
and what it actually costs.

178
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,660
We're going to put some things in place

179
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,830
to make sure you don't
go over budget either.

180
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,130
We'll talk about those in a future lesson.

181
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,980
The project board is going
to control the project

182
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,030
using this project plan
and those stage boundaries.

183
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,420
Every time we get to a boundary,

184
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,090
that's the chance for the project board

185
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,800
to get involved again and go,

186
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,070
nope, we're done, or yep, continue on.

187
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,360
The project manager's responsible

188
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,550
for updating that project plan and

189
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,170
they're also responsible for running

190
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,460
the day to day execution of the project.

191
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,830
That's all handled by the project manager

192
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,610
and using the manage
by exception principle,

193
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,821
which we're going to talk about next.

194
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,889
