1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,183
- Tailor to suit the project environment.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,280
So the last principle that we have is

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,800
tailoring to suit the project environment.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,370
And this asks the question how can PRINCE2

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,160
be adapted based on the size, scope

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
or complexity of the project to

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,060
meet the needs that we have.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,000
Do we have to have a one
size fits all solution?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,410
Well, of course not.

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,860
And that's the great thing about PRINCE2

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,360
is that it's highly adaptable,

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,730
specifically to each and every project.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,830
The projects are going to occur
in many different contexts.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,610
There's going to be cultural context,

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,870
geographical context, complexity,

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,110
and scale, and risk context.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,280
Every project is a little bit different,

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,670
but PRINCE2 can work with them all

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,330
if you want to tailor it.

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,510
So, when we look at it,
how do you adapt PRINCE2?

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,270
Well, tailoring and adapting
PRINCE2 is pretty easy.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,810
You can add things to it and
make it fit your organization.

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,690
So I mentioned in the manage
by exception principle,

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,110
that some people just do
away with the board meetings

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,096
because they're not required under PRINCE2

26
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,580
because you have this highlight

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,230
report that replaces them.

28
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,060
But many organizations still want to have

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,810
those regular progress meetings

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,080
and that's okay because in PRINCE2

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,530
that would be considered
an adaption or tailoring

32
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,350
of PRINCE2 to your
organizational standards.

33
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,610
There is nothing wrong with adding those

34
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,160
meetings if you want to.

35
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,720
But if you wanted to
take away the highlight

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,540
reports all-together, that really

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,770
wouldn't be much like PRINCE2 and so

38
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,300
adding is okay, but
taking away often is not.

39
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,450
Now, what do I do if
my organization tailors

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,400
PRINCE2 and we add those meetings,

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,180
or we add additional steps?

42
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,290
Well, you should document
any of those changes

43
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,290
inside the PID, or the Project
Initiation Documentation.

44
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,680
Remember, that's the document that we

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,160
set up before we started the project,

46
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,210
in the initiation stage.

47
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,250
This is going to provide an audit trail,

48
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,400
and evidence, that you're
compliant with PRINCE2

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,690
and that your organization is changing

50
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,590
things based on your standards.

51
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,610
This allows any time you
have an external audit

52
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,260
to come in, to go 'yep'
they're doing PRINCE2

53
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,970
even though they've added
this, this, this, and this.

54
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,340
Right? So this is an idea
that you want to make sure

55
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,920
you're documenting things
that are being changed.

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,630
Now, what if your project
is really, really small?

57
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,740
Can I drop things that are PRINCE2?

58
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,550
Well, no, you should still go through

59
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,270
every theme and every
process inside of PRINCE2

60
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,160
because otherwise you might
become an organization

61
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,780
that is doing PRINCE2 in name only and

62
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,540
you're losing a lot of
the benefits of PRINCE2.

63
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,440
So, what can you do when
your project is really small?

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,850
Well, you can speed up
or scale down processes

65
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,430
because each theme and process
needs to be considered,

66
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,700
but it might be considered for

67
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,400
just a short period of time.

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,450
Now, what does this really look like?

69
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,510
Well, if you've ever made a pizza,

70
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,180
you can make a personal pizza,

71
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,030
you can make a full size pizza,

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,430
or you can make a three foot wide pizza,

73
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,390
it just matters on whether you scale up

74
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,420
or scale down your ingredients.

75
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,570
PRINCE2 is much the same, you're still

76
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,490
going to need all of the ingredients.

77
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,900
You still need all the
themes and all the processes,

78
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,590
but you can go through
them very quickly if needed

79
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,130
and that will allow you to get through it

80
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,040
in a small environment
much quicker than having

81
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,130
to bring together the
full scale of PRINCE2.

82
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,750
And again, that's where
that adaption comes in.

83
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,400
Now, can you change what things

84
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,310
are called inside of PRINCE2?

85
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,443
Well, certainly. And the good news is

86
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:26,210
you're not breaking rules by doing it.

87
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,300
Terminology can be
difficult and confusing and

88
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,490
people call things all
sorts of different things.

89
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,240
The important thing is
that we're all using

90
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,450
common terminology and
you can use the PRINCE2

91
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,170
term and that will give you a common

92
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,577
terminology or your organization can

93
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,174
change those terms as
long as the organization

94
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:47,400
consistently uses the same wording.

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,720
So, for example, many organizations don't

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,780
use the PRINCE2 term of
Project Product Description.

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,420
Instead, they call it
a Requirements Document

98
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,830
and that's perfectly fine.

99
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,790
My organization, we call it
our Requirements Document.

100
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,410
Everybody knows that's what it is,

101
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,460
it still meets all the requirement for

102
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,310
a Project Product Description,

103
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,320
we just call it a Requirements Document.

104
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,170
And that's perfectly acceptable.

105
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,670
It also allows us to
keep our terms consistent

106
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,610
throughout, so I don't really care

107
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,570
what you call the thing, as long

108
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,710
as you call it the same thing every time.

109
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,990
Because that way everyone on the

110
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,820
team knows what you're talking about.

111
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,030
And it's really helpful to
create a glossary of terms.

112
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,160
So if you're not going to use the

113
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,180
standard PRINCE2 terminology,

114
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,190
you should have your own mini-dictionary,

115
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,890
essentially, that says we call

116
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,470
it a Requirements Document and that

117
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,890
equates to Project Product Description.

118
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,190
And so if you can have that cross

119
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,910
reference documentation, go ahead

120
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,030
and put that into an annex into your PID,

121
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,720
that way everyone knows what everything

122
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,370
is being called and you're going to

123
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,680
stay within the PRINCE2 framework.

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,980
Now, each piece of
PRINCE2 is very important

125
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,660
and no part of the
methodology should be ignored.

126
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,800
We already talked about the fact that

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,370
you need to go through all seven themes.

128
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,360
The business case, the organization,

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,770
the quality, the plans, the risk,

130
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,030
the change, the progress and

131
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,830
all seven of the processes.

132
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,790
But you may do them in shorter
time or scale them down.

133
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,890
Adapting PRINCE2 is a good thing,

134
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,790
in fact it's a great thing because

135
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,840
it focuses on the decisions being made

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,970
by the managers and not necessarily

137
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,700
on documents and templates and meetings.

138
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,340
That is the pure power of PRINCE2.

139
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,220
And why it is such a
great methodology to use

140
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,020
for your project management.

141
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,660
Now, can I add more
themes during tailoring?

142
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,930
Certainly. PRINCE2 only gives you

143
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,860
those seven themes we just talked about,

144
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,540
but you can always add more.

145
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,210
So maybe you need a human resource theme,

146
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,910
or a communications theme,

147
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,100
or a legal theme, or a financial,

148
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,170
or a health and safety, or something

149
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,720
else that really applies
only to your business.

150
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,940
That's okay, your
organization can add these in,

151
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,040
but please don't take away the seven

152
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,920
core themes because that's going to hurt

153
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,023
your project and put you more at risk.
