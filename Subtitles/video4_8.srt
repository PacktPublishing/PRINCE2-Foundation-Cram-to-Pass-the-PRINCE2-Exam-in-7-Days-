1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,530
- Closing a project.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,920
So our final process is closing a project,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,100
and closing a project is
going to provide us with

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,240
a fixed point at which acceptance
of the project's product

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,830
has been confirmed.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,960
This is going to recognize
that the objectives set

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,720
out in the original
project initiation document

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
have been achieved and met,

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,870
or that the project has
nothing more to contribute

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,660
because we're closing it
early because we failed,

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,000
or we decided it was no
longer a valid business case.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,820
Now, this is a process, it
is not a separate stage,

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,720
as you can see here on
our process timeline.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,280
On our process timeline, you'll
see that closing a project

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,770
is a managing level process,
and it's going to occur

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,510
in the final stage.

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,690
Now, once we get to
this closing a project,

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,430
this is going to happen because
we've been told to do it

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,120
through the directing a project process,

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,770
it will be approved and then
we will close out this project.

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,090
Let's talk a little bit more
about closing out a project.

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,790
What's involved with that?

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,260
Well there's a couple of
things we need to achieve.

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,280
We want to ensure that there's
a clear end to the project,

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,770
because projects are time constrained,

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,010
they shouldn't go on forever and ever,

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,630
they should achieve something
as a temporary organization

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,420
and then be taken apart.

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,790
This is going to ensure that
we can transition the product

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,120
of this project to the customer,
make sure they have it,

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,840
they've accepted it and
they are now operating it.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,210
We're going to ensure that
project management resources

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,120
can be released, so when we
built this whole project,

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,560
we had a project board with
an executive and a senior user

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,330
and a senior supplier, and
maybe a change authority,

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,010
and we had a project manager,
and we had teams that

37
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,270
were working on this.

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,550
All those people now that
we're done with the project

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,580
can be released back to their own jobs,

40
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,460
and we're also going to
ensure that no more costs

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,080
can be incurred by the project.

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,470
If you don't close out a
project, there may still be

43
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,010
a line of accounting out there,

44
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,200
and people can be charging things to it,

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,070
and so you want to make sure
that is appropriately closed down

46
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,440
as well.

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,780
Now in addition to those basic
objectives we talked about,

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,860
there's a couple of
follow-on recommendations

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,500
that you want to capture as
part of this closing a project.

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,690
You want to document any outstanding items

51
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,430
that were never completed,
because maybe you just didn't

52
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,630
get to them, maybe they were
additional things that were

53
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,360
minor things that didn't
need to be completed for this

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,660
project to be closed,

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,470
or maybe the project was terminated early

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,890
and so you have a half finished product.

57
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,470
That needs to be listed so
people can maybe pick it up

58
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,860
later on and run with
it again at a time when

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,800
there is a better business case.

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,090
Also, if there were any
changes that were asked for

61
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,130
that weren't implemented,
you need to make sure

62
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,350
those are passed on to the
operational customer as well,

63
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,460
and any risks that may
still affect operations,

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,010
like we talked about networks,

65
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,160
there's always going to be
some vulnerabilities out there,

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,270
there's always going to
be down time concerns,

67
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,060
those type of risks should
be passed on to operations

68
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,640
as well so they can follow up on them.

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,410
All of these things will be
part of your end project report

70
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,320
that says what the end
status of this project was.

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,690
Now, we are going to create,
as a project manager,

72
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,640
a draft project closure notice.

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,360
This is one of our final things that we do

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,900
as we prepare it and send
it up to the project board

75
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,120
for their approval.

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,360
This happens and then the
directing a project process

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,580
will either approve it or deny it.

78
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,070
If they approve our
project closure notice,

79
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,450
that means we can then start
this closing a project process

80
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,640
and close out the project properly.

81
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,630
When the project closure is authorized,

82
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,490
all management projects
should be securely archived

83
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,520
and available for any future audits

84
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,600
because remember, as part of prints two,

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,990
somebody can come in
and audit our work later

86
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,640
for quality assurance.

87
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,520
We need to make sure we
don't delete anything,

88
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,600
we want to make sure it's all
properly archived and saved.

89
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,840
So, what is the end state
when we finish the closure

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,990
of the project?

91
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,950
Well, the products are
transferred over to the customer

92
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,810
and they're using them

93
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,700
and getting the benefits they thought.

94
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,020
The project management team
is going to return to their

95
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,960
normal roles, or if they're
just a dedicated project

96
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,800
management team, they're going
to start another project.

97
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,050
The benefits of this
project have been realized

98
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,260
by the customer.

99
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,280
We were told to build a
network so that another hundred

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
employees could be in the building.

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,580
Well, we did it, those
hundred employees are there,

102
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,120
they're on the network and
they're working properly.

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,380
Great, project can be closed.

104
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,130
And we want to document
any lessons learned again,

105
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,040
because we may use these
in future projects,

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,090
so let's take the network example.

107
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,680
If I built a new network
for an office building

108
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,720
that was going to support a hundred users,

109
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
do you think I may ever do that again?

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,900
Well, certainly, when we
grow for another hundred,

111
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,850
we're going to have to do
the same type of thing again,

112
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,880
so the lessons I learned from this project

113
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,540
will be useful to whoever's
going to be running that project,

114
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,940
so we want to make sure
they're properly captured.
