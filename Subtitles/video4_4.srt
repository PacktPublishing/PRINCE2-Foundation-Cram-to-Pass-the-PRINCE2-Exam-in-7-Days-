1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,603
- Initiating a project.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,190
Now that we have looked
at starting up a project,

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,750
and directing a project,

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,370
that brings us to initiating the project.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,810
This is where we're going to establish

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,450
the sound foundations for this project

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,710
and enable the organization to understand

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,730
the work that's going to need to be done

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,390
to deliver an actual
product at the end of it,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,880
before we start agreeing to spend

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,370
a significant amount of
time, money, and resources.

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,700
Let's look at this on
the process timeline.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,620
You can see here,

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,730
we started in the pre-project phase.

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,640
Somebody had a good idea and a
project mandate was provided.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,390
We then went through and started up

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,740
a project to support this great idea

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,810
that we think had a valid business case.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,240
The project board is then
working to direct the project.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,107
You can see how it goes from
starting up a project up,

21
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,950
back to that high level

22
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,120
and down into the directing a project.

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,520
Directing a project is going to tell

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,271
the initiation of a project

25
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:59,500
that they need to go forth

26
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,730
and create the process
initiation document,

27
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,640
or the PID, which we've
mentioned several times before.

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,150
But we're going to talk about it much more

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,810
in depth in this lesson.

30
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,960
Then, once we get that valid PID,

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,470
and we know what those benefits are,

32
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,810
and the time and the scope,

33
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,100
it's going to go back up
to directing a project

34
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,790
for their approval and this
project will become initiated.

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,254
Let's go ahead and look at
what the objectives are.

36
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:25,620
Our objectives of initiating a project

37
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,490
are to identify the reasons,
the time scale, the cost,

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,810
the scope, the major products,
the expected benefits,

39
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,980
and any risk we can think of
associated with this project.

40
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,750
This project, we also need to identify

41
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,660
the quality requirements and the standards

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,750
that are going to be used.

43
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,390
We need to identify what
a baseline product will be

44
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,700
and how it's going to be controlled
through change management.

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,550
And then we also need to
identify our communications plan

46
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,670
and what are the communication
needs of our stakeholders

47
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,470
and how we're going to meet those.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,100
A lot of those things
we've talked about already

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,060
are now coming together
inside initiating a project.

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,200
Now, when we look at all of that,

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,070
the main product we're going to have

52
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,970
is what's called the project
initiation document, the PID.

53
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,436
And it has to contain the project plan.

54
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:14,410
What stages will there be and
how many stages will there be?

55
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,280
It needs to have a detailed business case.

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,540
We're going to take the outline

57
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,120
and make it fully formed at this point.

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,580
We're going to have a
communication management approach.

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,670
Who are we going to talk to,

60
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,450
at what frequency and with what method?

61
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,170
We're going to have a
risk management approach

62
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,370
so that we can codify that
risk theme into this process.

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,990
We're going to have a
quality management approach

64
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,900
so again, we're going to
take the quality theme

65
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,560
and make it get some legs

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,620
and start putting it into this project.

67
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,000
We're going to look at change theme

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,850
and use the change control approach,

69
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,724
and start moving that through the process.

70
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:47,250
We're going to also have project controls,

71
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,010
so we know what are the time

72
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,092
and tolerance controls we're going to use.

73
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:54,040
We're going to have any
PRINCE2 tailoring we do,

74
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,800
has to be identified
here in our PID as well.

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,750
Like we talked about all
the way back in principles.

76
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,190
So, you can see how those principles

77
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,360
and themes start coming together now,

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,930
inside this project initiation document,

79
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,400
which happens inside the
initiating a project process.

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Now, the outputs from initiating a project

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,040
are obviously going to be the PID,

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,200
the project initiation document.

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
But the other output we need

84
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,919
is a benefits management approach.

85
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,550
If you remember back,

86
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,550
who was in charge of the
benefits management approach?

87
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,900
The benefits management approach

88
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,070
was the responsibility of the senior user.

89
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,010
They're going to describe how the benefits

90
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,010
are going to be measured,
how often and by whom.

91
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,810
They're also going to update it at the end

92
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,900
of the project and turn this over,

93
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,300
because it becomes an active document

94
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,500
that's going to be used during

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,930
the products operational lifetime.

96
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,480
It's also going to be turned
over to the corporate office,

97
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,810
the program management office,

98
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,300
or the customer at the project closure,

99
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,416
so they know what those things are.

100
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,750
What does this really look
like in the real world?

101
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,520
Let's say I was building a network.

102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,630
The senior user might have told me

103
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,910
that one of the things we were
going to do was measure uptime.

104
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,470
That's what's going to be measured.

105
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,970
We're going to measure it every week

106
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,470
and take an average and
it's going to be measured

107
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,490
by the service operations team.

108
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,400
That is what the benefit is,

109
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,640
how much uptime, how often, and by whom.

110
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,250
Now, when we build,

111
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,940
we're building it to meet
those project, those benefit.

112
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,450
Now, when I build this network,

113
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm going to build it to meet
the benefits management approach.

114
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,060
I want to make sure I meet
the metrics I was told.

115
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,790
Say, 99% uptime.

116
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,300
But, once I build this network

117
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,412
and turn it over to the customer,

118
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:34,930
it's not my problem anymore,

119
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,430
the project is over, right?

120
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,710
So, I'm going to turn
that approach over to them

121
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,690
so they know how they can measure it

122
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,310
and make sure they're maintaining
the uptime that they need

123
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,703
for that product to be successful.
