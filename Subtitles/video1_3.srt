1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,770
- Exam Fundamentals.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,520
So what are you really
here in this class for?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,610
Well, you're probably here
because you're going to take

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,320
the PRINCE2 foundation exam.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,450
And so you want to
learn all about PRINCE2,

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,200
so you can pass that exam.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,060
But before we do that, let's
talk about the exam itself,

8
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,060
just for a couple of minutes.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,940
The exam is the first level
of certification in PRINCE2.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,730
There's actually two other
levels that you could go for.

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,690
And the PRINCE2 foundation is going to

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,290
introduce the method of PRINCE2.

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,910
It really tests, do you understand PRINCE2

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,080
and can you work in a project team

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,470
that uses the PRINCE2 environment.

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,960
You have to pass this
foundation level exam

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,080
before you can take one of the other two,

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,620
if you desire to continue.

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,340
And those are the practitioner and

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,070
the agile practitioner certifications.

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,540
The PRINCE2 foundation
exam is a 60 question exam

22
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,250
that you have to take in under 60 minutes.

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,190
The good news is, it's
a multiple choice exam.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,810
So you just have to be able
to recognize the right answer.

25
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,920
You don't have to
regurgitate it in an essay

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,050
or a short answer format.

27
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,440
Now the exam itself only requires

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,740
55 percent correct to pass.

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,800
That's 33 correct answers
out of 60 possible questions.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,650
The exam is closed book,
so you can't take any notes

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,090
into your testing environment,

32
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,880
and you can't use any study guides.

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,000
It all has to be
recognized from your brain.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,050
And finally, an important
thing, is that this exam

35
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,690
and this course is based off
of the January 2018 update,

36
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,630
which is that PRINCE 2017 objectives

37
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,330
we talked about in the last lesson.

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,110
So are you ready to go sit for the exam?

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,590
Well probably not yet, 'cause you're

40
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,000
just starting this course.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,020
But how do you know when you are ready?

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,250
Well you should take practice exams.

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,380
And at the end of this
course I've provided you with

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,260
two full length practice exams to try.

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,270
If you're scoring at
least 70 percent or higher

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,430
on those practice exams,
you're ready to take

47
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,980
the real certification.

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,240
Now, why do I say 70
percent if the passing score

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,870
is only 55 percent on test day?

50
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,880
Well, because a lot of things
are factors on test day.

51
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,130
You may be nervous.

52
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,170
You may not have gotten
a good night sleep.

53
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,410
All these different things
can affect your test score.

54
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,460
And I've seen students who have a variable

55
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,520
of about 10 percent in their test score.

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,940
So if you're scoring 70% on my exam,

57
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,040
you may score 80 percent on test day,

58
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,210
or you may score 60 percent.

59
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,710
Either way though, you'd pass.

60
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,220
And that's why we set
the bar at 70 percent.

61
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,160
Because I want to make
sure you only have to take

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,560
the PRINCE2 exam once, because
it does cost a lot of money

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,890
to sit for that exam.

64
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,020
So what do you do if you're not scoring

65
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,510
70 percent or higher?

66
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,720
Well you want to go back and
study the areas that you're

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,050
missing, but you want
to continue to take new

68
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,910
and varied practice exams.

69
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,080
So if you need more
practice, take additional

70
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
practice exams.

71
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,690
You can find them on my website,
you can find them on Udemy,

72
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,490
you can find them
elsewhere on the internet,

73
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,370
but take a couple of practice exams

74
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,100
until you're scoring at least 70 percent.

75
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,080
Because you really only want
to attempt the certification

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
exam once, and you want to
pass it on your first attempt.

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,770
This course is going to
teach you everything you need

78
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,960
to be able to pass it
on your first attempt.

79
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,540
But you've got to get
comfortable with taking those

80
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,860
practice exams because that's
what you're going to be doing

81
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,180
on test day.

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,740
Now, when you pass the exam,
and notice I said when,

83
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,160
not if, when you pass it
I want to hear about it.

84
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,330
So post in the Q and A section,
post in our Facebook group

85
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,530
and let me know when you are
PRINCE2 foundation certified.

86
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,600
Now once you are certified,
where do you go from there?

87
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,490
Well for many, this is going
to be the only certification

88
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,370
project management you want to get.

89
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,300
But for others, you may
want to move up the chain,

90
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,020
and from the PRINCE2
foundation there are two places

91
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,160
you can go, the practitioner
and the agile practitioner.

92
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,350
The PRINCE2 practitioner
is designed for people

93
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,420
who are going to manage the projects.

94
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,950
Remember, we said the foundation level

95
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,130
was for people who are
working inside the projects

96
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,310
as part of the team.

97
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,780
But practitioner is the guy who's

98
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,440
going to be leading the team.

99
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,260
It focuses on the day-to-day
workings of PRINCE2

100
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,850
and how to apply and tailor the method

101
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,820
to different project
environments you may come across.

102
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,900
Like I said, PRINCE2 is very flexible.

103
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,530
But if you're dealing with a large project

104
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,560
that's like building a house,
or a small project like

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,340
making a catering event, either
way PRINCE2 can fit for it

106
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,060
but you have to understand
how to apply it.

107
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,040
And that's what the practitioner
exam really focuses on.

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,770
Now on the bottom of the
screen here you can see

109
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,370
the agile practitioner.

110
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,560
This is that second
exam, and this focus is

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,330
for people who are
using PRINCE2 in a Scrum

112
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,500
or Kanban agile environment.

113
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,790
And this is going to be focused
on working with projects,

114
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,150
products, and program delivery in a very

115
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,930
time compressed format.

116
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,180
So whichever one your organization uses,

117
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,020
that's the one you should be going for,

118
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,163
whether its the practitioner
or the agile practitioner.
