1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,950
- PRINCE2 Foundation.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,960
So what exactly is PRINCE2?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,500
Well, PRINCE2 is a project
management methodology,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,540
and it was first put together back in 1989

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,830
under the name, Projects
In Controlled Environments.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,830
PRINCE2 is the evolution of that.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,800
Back in 1996, PRINCE went
through a major evolution

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,733
and it became this updated
version known as PRINCE2.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,330
Now it has become the
defacto standard in both

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,910
the United Kingdom and
throughout the United Nations.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,710
In 2009, the name was
changed just slightly

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,880
as some exam objectives were updated,

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,460
and it became Projects In
A Controlled Environment.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,460
Now finally, last year in 2017,
the exam updated once more,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,570
this time to include some Agile

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,330
and Development Ops type issues,

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,610
and that became PRINCE2 2017,

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,780
as you're going to be
tested on on your exam.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,180
Now, do you have to
memorize this whole history?

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,050
No, I just wanted to give you
an idea of where it came from.

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,960
The big takeaway here is
that PRINCE2 has been around

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,180
in some form or another
for about 30 years,

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,230
and it's been able to be
evolved through best practices

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,150
to make sure that it is a methodology

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,733
that's going to perform
well for your organizations.

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,000
Now what is PRINCE2 exactly?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,670
Well, it's this methodology,
and it is one of the world's

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,990
most popular project
management methodologies.

29
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,430
It focuses on three key areas,

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,250
the principles, the
themes, and the processes,

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,420
and each of those will
have seven distinct items.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,770
We're going to cover each of those

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,050
throughout the next couple of hours.

34
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,010
Now PRINCE2 also is
available to be tailored,

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,310
and so, these concepts
from the principles,

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,980
the themes, and the processes,
they can all be tailored

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,020
to a particular project
regardless of the size,

38
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,870
so if you have a small
project, a large project,

39
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,160
or some project in between,
PRINCE2 can be used

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,240
and used effectively, so if
you're doing a large project

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,480
like building a skyscraper
that's going to cost

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,430
multi millions of dollars, and
it's really, really complex,

43
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,180
PRINCE2 can help with that,

44
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,910
but if you're going to build
a small ecommerce website,

45
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,940
well PRINCE2 can help with that too

46
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,530
because PRINCE2 can be
expanded or contracted

47
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,530
to fit the needs of your organization

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,810
and your particular
project, and that's what

49
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,600
tailoring for the
environment is all about.

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,250
Now when we talk about
those seven principles,

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,500
these are the building blocks
for PRINCE2's methodology.

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,130
They are continued business justification,

53
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,830
learn from experience, define
roles and responsibilities,

54
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,200
manage by stages, manage by
exception, focus on products,

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,730
and of course, tailor to the environment.

56
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,700
We'll talk about each of
these seven principles

57
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,973
in depth in the next
section of the course.

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,610
There's also seven themes, and these are

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,220
the project management
areas that have to be

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,690
continually addressed during the project,

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,670
so from the start of the
project until it's closed out,

62
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,140
you're continually looking at these things

63
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,620
again, and again, and again.

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,030
These are things like the business case,

65
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,210
the organization, the quality, the plans,

66
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,610
the risk, the change, and the progress.

67
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,520
And finally, we have the seven processes,

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,720
and the seven processes
are going to describe

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,000
the who, what, and when of the project.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
These are things like
starting up a project,

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,740
initiating a project, directing a project,

72
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,070
controlling a stage,
managing product delivery,

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,990
managing a stage boundary,
and closing the project

74
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,540
when you're all completed.

75
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,810
Again, we're going to
talk about each of these

76
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,340
three sets of sevens
throughout the rest of

77
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,203
our time together in this course.
