1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,230
- Directing A Project.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,540
Now, I know you were excited

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,370
to get in to Initiating A Project

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,700
because we've just left
Starting Up A Project,

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
but first, we have to direct the project,

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,120
and this is going to happen
across multiple phases

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,560
in the project.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,270
We'll talk about Directing A Project,

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,160
we're talking about how we're
going to enable our Project Board

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,610
to be accountable for
the project's success

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,010
by making those key
decisions and exercising

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,090
the overall control, while
delegating our day-to-day

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,980
management of the project
down to the project manager.

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,945
Remember, we want to manage by exception.

15
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:34,526
We want to push down those
authorities when we can

16
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:37,060
to free up the executive's time.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,480
Now, when we look at this
on the Process Timeline,

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,790
you can see where Directing a Project is.

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,360
It's going to cover this Directing layer,

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,990
and it's going to go across
the Initiation Stage,

21
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,670
the Subsequent Stages,
and the Final Stage,

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,470
and so, it's really, really important,

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,910
because it really is the bridge
across our Process Timeline.

24
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,160
So when we deal with Directing A Process,

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,350
we have a couple of objectives.

26
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,330
First, we need to provide authority

27
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,220
to initiate the project,
to get it started,

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,170
to deliver the project's products,
and to close the project.

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,350
Anytime we want to move
from one stage to another,

30
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,070
we are going to be utilizing
Directing A Project's process.

31
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,260
This is going to provide
management the direction

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,630
and control throughout the
project's entire lifecycle,

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,440
and it's going to ensure that
the project remains viable,

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,150
because before we leave one
stage and go to the next,

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,710
we're going to get that go/no-go decision

36
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,600
through Directing A Project.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,100
Next, we want to make sure
it provides the corporate,

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,830
the program management, or the customer,

39
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,400
an interface within the project,

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,670
and that is through this Project Board

41
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,950
that does Directing A Project,

42
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,640
and it's going to manage and
review the post-project benefits

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,540
to make sure that the product
that the project makes

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,560
does meet the requirements
that were set out

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,480
and agreed upon all the
back in the original

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,220
Starting Up A Project phase
and the Initializing A Project,

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,560
which we'll talk about in the next lesson.

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,770
Now, what is going to trigger
Directing A Project process?

49
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,500
Well, this process is
going to be initiated

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,980
and begin, once the Starting
Up A Project process

51
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,320
is completed.

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,490
Once that mandate has been received,

53
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,900
and the request to initiate is received,

54
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,800
we are going to go ahead and
start directing this project,

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,970
because we've now identified
who is those key roles

56
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,600
on the Project Board.

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,170
That Project Board is now
responsible for ensuring

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,770
that a business justification exists,

59
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,890
and continues to exist
through every other stage

60
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,270
of the project.

61
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,390
They're going to utilize
manage by exception

62
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,320
to direct the progress, and
allow the project manager

63
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,200
to do their job on a day-to-day basis

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,580
and take care of the minor issues.

65
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,970
Anytime it's something that has to come up

66
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,410
through an exception, it goes back up here

67
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,130
to Directing A Project
process for a decision.

68
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,390
When I think of Directing
A Project process,

69
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,200
I think about decision making,

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,270
specifically at the Project Board,

71
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,080
and so there are five key activities

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
that the Project Board is
going to be concerned with.

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,080
They need to authorize the
initiation of the project

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,710
and ensure that the
investment is worthwhile.

75
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,100
They need to authorize the project itself.

76
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,810
Their going to approve the
Project Initiation Document,

77
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,660
which is going to be created
in the Initialization Stage,

78
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,380
which we're going to talk about next,

79
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,400
and if they think this
project has a firm foundation.

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,460
That we know, the scope, the
cost, the time, the risk,

81
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,770
the benefits, who's responsible for what,

82
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,740
and how progress will be monitored.

83
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,490
All of that has to be shown

84
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,770
in the Progress Initiation Document,

85
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,430
so that they can authorize the project.

86
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,800
The third thing they
do is authorize a stage

87
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,240
or an exception plan.

88
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,700
Remember, they're going to
create the overall project plan

89
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,930
and approve it, and then they're
going to authorize stage plans

90
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,280
or exception plans to go forward,

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,930
when there's an issue
or when there's a plan

92
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,760
created by the project manager.

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,190
They're going to review the
performance of the current stage

94
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,300
and approve the next stage,
before they move forward.

95
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,300
They're also going to
approve product descriptions

96
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,310
as part of that plan, so they know

97
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,530
what they're going to get out of it,

98
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,200
and what the end product of
that stage is going to be,

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,270
and they're going to
review the lessons report

100
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,330
and decide who should receive them.

101
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,658
Should it stay within this project,

102
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:17,010
or should they share
it with other projects?

103
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,870
That is something that the
Project Board is going to handle.

104
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,330
Fourth, they're going to
give ad-hoc direction,

105
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,490
and that means they're going to
review the highlight reports,

106
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,760
the issue, and the exception reports.

107
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,830
They're going to make
decisions about these issues,

108
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,400
the risks, and the changes,

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,170
and they're going to give
advice to that project manager,

110
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,630
and finally, they're going
to communicate that up

111
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,460
and across to the different stakeholders.

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,500
The fifth and final activity
they're going to do,

113
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,600
is authorizing the closure of the project,

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,930
and that means they're
going to approve and review

115
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,160
the end project report that is created

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,460
by the project manager, as
well as their lessons report.

117
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,120
Once they take all that information,

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,670
they can then go in to and
approve the project closure,

119
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,450
and we'll talk about that and what happens

120
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,263
in Closing A Project.
