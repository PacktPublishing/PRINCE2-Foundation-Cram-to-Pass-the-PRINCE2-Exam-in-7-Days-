1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,150
- Plans.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,270
So the plans theme is going to help us

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,270
to facilitate communication

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,240
and control by defining the means

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,020
of delivering the products.

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,070
This is where we start building our plans

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,090
that we can work towards
to build our products.

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,860
This is going to define the how,

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,010
when, how much, by whom,

10
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,310
and where the project will deliver

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,140
the final products and outcomes.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,160
There are three levels of plans
that we've mentioned before.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,740
The project plan, the stage
plan, and the team plan.

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,880
Now, the project plan is
used by the project board.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,450
This is going to contain
the project level costs,

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,090
the timescales, and the control points.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,630
It's going to tell us how
many stages there are,

18
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,650
and when those stages happen.

19
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,110
It's going to be updated at the end

20
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,790
of each stage to reflect
the actual progress

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,150
and revise forecast so we know going

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,520
forward what we are budgeting for.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,350
Underneath those, we're
going to have the stage plan,

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,840
and the stage plan is going
to have one per project stage.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,670
It's used for the day-to-day management

26
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,900
of the project by our project manager.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,840
And then we have our team plan,

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,040
and this is going to be
used by our team managers.

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,230
This is also known as work packages.

30
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,650
These cover the work to be done by a team.

31
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,640
And there can be multiple work packages

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,540
or multiple team packages in
existence at any one time.

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,130
So if I'm using the example
of building a house,

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,210
maybe we are in the stage

35
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,290
where we're going to build a bathroom.

36
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,460
In that stage, I'm going to
have a plumber's work package,

37
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm going to have an
electrician's work package,

38
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,210
somebody to tile the floors,

39
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,110
and somebody to install the fixtures,

40
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,970
so maybe three, four, five
different work packages.

41
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,670
But they're still only one stage
and that stage is one piece

42
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,670
of the larger project plan

43
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,030
that is used to build the whole house.

44
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,240
So you can see these things
nest inside of each other.

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,830
Now, when I look at an exception plan,

46
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,560
this is when something goes wrong

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,140
and I have to deviate
from the project plan,

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,860
the stage plan, or the team plan.

49
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,330
A new plan will be created
to replace one of those,

50
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,250
either the stage plan

51
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,450
or the project plan to overcome an issue.

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,560
This is not an updated
version of an existing plan,

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,100
but it's instead a change and a new way

54
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,780
of approaching things.

55
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,840
Corporate or program
management are the ones

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,580
to approve a change to the project plan,

57
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,500
and the project board will
change the stage plan.

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,250
So remember, the stage plan is
used by the project manager.

59
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,560
If there is an exception,

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,160
his bosses, the project board,
need to make that change.

61
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,650
Just like the project plan

62
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,210
is owned by the project
board and the executive.

63
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,530
If there needs to be a change to it,

64
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,100
they have to go to their boss,

65
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,490
which is corporate or program management.

66
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,410
And so it keeps going up the
ladder to get that change made.

67
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,630
Now, when we look at budget planning,

68
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,230
we have to plan and consider
for many different things.

69
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,990
The first is the product
and management funding.

70
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,420
Because there's costs associated

71
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,970
with building this final product

72
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,960
and there's overhead to pay

73
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,210
the project manager, the project board,

74
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,040
and all the people doing that.

75
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,060
This is the activities

76
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,740
to create the specialized products

77
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,760
and the management of those products.

78
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,600
We also need a change budget,

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,960
and that's because nothing

80
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,230
is going to go perfectly the way you plan.

81
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,440
There's always going to
be some sort of change

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,590
that's requested by your customer.

83
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,010
Change budget is used
for authorized changes

84
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,640
to the baseline products.

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,340
So when they've gotten version one out,

86
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,890
and now we are trying to get version 1.1,

87
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,723
because somebody decided

88
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,050
to change the font on our slide deck,

89
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,370
or they wanted to change the
graphics used on the website.

90
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,970
Whatever those things are,

91
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,110
we have to pay for that,

92
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,580
and the change budget
pays for those changes.

93
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,700
This goes through the
change management process,

94
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,170
through an RFC or request for change,

95
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,660
and the change authority
has this change budget

96
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,700
that they can authorize
and pay for changes with.

97
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,330
There's also a risk budget,

98
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,320
because there is risk
inherent in everything we do.

99
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,640
And so activities that need

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,600
to respond to risk are going to be covered

101
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,030
from the risk budget.

102
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,670
Maybe we are building a house

103
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,170
and it rained so much

104
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,490
that we can't pour the foundation
without draining the lot

105
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,770
and we need to rent some
pumps to get the water out.

106
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,860
Well, those pumps could be
paid for using the risk budget.

107
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,390
It was something that wasn't planned for,

108
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,920
it wasn't something that was expected,

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,830
and so the risk budget
can pick up the slack.

110
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,170
And finally, we have cost tolerance.

111
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,290
Cost tolerance is any cost overruns

112
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,490
that happen within a certain tolerance.

113
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,810
We talked about tolerances
back in the last section

114
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,130
of this course, and we talked about

115
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,730
that we may have a plus
10% tolerance on something.

116
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,800
Well, if it's $100,000 project,

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,800
we would then have a $10,000,
so if it's $100,000 project,

118
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,100
we would have 10,000 or 10%
set aside for cost overruns

119
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,680
that are within tolerance.

120
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,710
And if it's within the tolerance,

121
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,410
you don't have to go up to your
boss to ask for more money,

122
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,090
because you have that money available.

123
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,900
Now, when we talk about
product-based planning,

124
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,770
we're going to write a
project product description,

125
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,130
and that's going to define
what the project must deliver.

126
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,840
So what is that end product?

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,770
Is it the house?

128
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,870
Is it a car?

129
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,880
Is it a website?

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,060
Is it a network?

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,610
Whatever that thing is,

132
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,810
we have to write up a description of it,

133
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,460
and it's not just going to
say that this is a red car,

134
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,600
but we're going to talk about the fact

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,530
that it's a red four-door sedan

136
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,040
that can go zero to 60 in five seconds.

137
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,980
And do x, y, z, and et cetera.

138
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,840
That's your product description.

139
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,673
You're also going to have

140
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:19,900
to create a product breakdown structure.

141
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,840
So using our car example,

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,673
there are other products

143
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:25,130
that have to built to go into the car.

144
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,180
I need airbags, I need seats.

145
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,400
I need upholstery.

146
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,330
I need gauges.

147
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,440
I need wiring.

148
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,500
And we're going to break those down

149
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,600
into individual smaller products

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,740
that we can then put into
the larger, car product.

151
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,690
We also need to write product descriptions

152
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,820
and these are written requirements
for every major product.

153
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,150
So if I need an airbag,

154
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,430
I better write the
description of that airbag.

155
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,000
How fast will it deploy?

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,870
How much pressure can it take?

157
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,130
All of those types of facts and figures.

158
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,700
And finally, we need to
create a product flow diagram.

159
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,970
This is what you've probably
seen of as a Gantt chart.

160
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,470
If you see the icon above my head,

161
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,300
that's really a simple version
of a product flow diagram.

162
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,930
You can see there's
four different products,

163
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,390
and I'm on schedule on the top two

164
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,970
and I'm not on the bottom two.

165
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,040
And where we are and what needs to be done

166
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,590
in which sequence,

167
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,430
and usually you'll see for instance

168
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,920
that you have to do item one
before you can do item two.

169
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,510
So if I go to my house example,

170
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,780
I have to pour the foundation
before I can put up the walls.

171
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,270
I need to put in the electrical

172
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,590
and the plumbing before
I put in the drywall.

173
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,000
I need the drywall to be
in before I can paint it.

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
And so as a product manager,

175
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,370
I need to be able to time and sequence all

176
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,320
of these things to get the most done

177
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,010
in the least amount of time.

178
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,610
I can have the electricians

179
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,660
and the plumbers working at the same time,

180
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,810
but I can't have the
drywallers in there too,

181
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,260
because they'll be covering up areas

182
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,060
that those two other teams need.

183
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,030
That's the idea here when

184
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,610
you start creating your
product flow diagram.

185
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,900
It doesn't necessarily
need dates at this point,

186
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,020
but it does need to know
big muscle movement a needs

187
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,073
to come before muscle movement b.

188
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,450
Then we start looking at
planning for our stages.

189
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,510
We start bundling things together.

190
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,390
We're going to have to determine

191
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,180
how long each stage is going to be.

192
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,910
And we talk about stages,

193
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,090
we're going to talk about the fact

194
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,370
that you have to have a minimum

195
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,890
of two stages inside of PRINCE2.

196
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,280
You must have initiating a product stage,

197
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,990
and then you have to have
conducting the stage itself.

198
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,560
And so that'll be two different stages.

199
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,730
But you can have many many
more stages than that.

200
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,563
And so you're going to have

201
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,640
to determine how many stages there will be

202
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,330
for your particular project.

203
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,440
For small projects, you may
only have the minimum of two.

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,480
If you're doing something large,

205
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,690
it may be five, 10, or 15 stages.

206
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,620
It really depends on how
comfortable the project board

207
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,250
is with that project manager,

208
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,420
and how much room between
go/no go decisions they want.

209
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,450
How far out can you realistically plan?

210
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,020
That's your planning horizon.

211
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,040
The longer you can see out,

212
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,050
the more they're going to
allow you to have less stages.

213
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,800
How many delivery steps will there be?

214
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,250
Are we going to deliver
everything in one big piece,

215
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,950
or we've only got a website
with 10 different features

216
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,090
and we're going to do 10
stages, one for each feature?

217
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,640
Does it align with other program

218
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,050
activities that are going on?

219
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,920
And what level of risks there is.

220
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,040
If it is a more risky project,
you will have more stages.

221
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,440
If it is a less risky project,
you will have less stages.

222
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,190
I'll give you a great example of this.

223
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,800
Recently, I built a house

224
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,320
about two years ago for us to live in.

225
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,550
And when we built this house,

226
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,470
we went with a builder who
builds a lot of houses.

227
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,320
And so there was only three
stages that were done,

228
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,500
and of those three stages,

229
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,350
they came back to us
for go/no go decisions.

230
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,050
Now, we felt very comfortable with that,

231
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,000
because this builder builds
hundreds of houses a year,

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,400
and in fact they only
build five floor plans.

233
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,680
And we had one of those five floor plans.

234
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,120
And so they had built this
same house many many times.

235
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,610
So it was a very low
risk environment for us,

236
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,630
and so we only had to have

237
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,550
that go/no go decision three times.

238
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,790
Now, if it was the first time
they've ever built the house,

239
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,230
and it was a custom house,

240
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,960
and there was all these
different changes going on,

241
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
we might have had five,

242
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,030
10, or 15 stages where we
can constantly have those

243
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,500
touch points to come
back and check on them.

244
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,720
But because this was
something that was low risk,

245
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,220
we didn't need that many stages.

246
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,920
So when it comes to plans,

247
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,860
PRINCE2 has a couple of
minimum requirements.

248
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,810
The first one is that your plans

249
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,440
have to be created in a way

250
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,080
to enable your business
case to be realized.

251
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,420
We're going to go from idea to product

252
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,940
and to do that, we need a plan.

253
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,840
Second, we are required to produce plans

254
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,490
and you do have to produce

255
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,990
at a minimum your project
plan and your stage plan.

256
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,690
You are not required to use
team plans or work packages

257
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,570
but it is highly recommended.

258
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,100
But the two that are required
is project and stage plans.

259
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,660
Next, you need to produce any
exception plans when required.

260
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,490
So if you go outside of tolerance,

261
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,910
you have to come up with a
way to get yourself back in

262
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,390
or you're going to have
to cancel the project.

263
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,680
We also have to create a
project product description,

264
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,090
our product descriptions

265
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,740
and our product breakdown structures

266
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,690
which give us that timing and
tempo of the different stages.

267
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,380
And finally, you have to go
back to organization again

268
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,310
and define roles and
responsibilities for planning.

269
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,480
Who is going to do this and
what is expected of them?

270
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,890
You'll see these themes come up

271
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,960
over and over and over again,

272
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,890
because even the themes
start building on themselves

273
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,668
and the underlying principles.

274
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,825
