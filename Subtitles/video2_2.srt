1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,503
- Continued business justification.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,220
So, continued business
justification is the first principle

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,530
we're going to look at.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,143
Continued business justification
asks one simple question:

5
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:16,360
Are the benefits still worth
the risks and the cost?

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,990
So when we look at a project we need

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,990
to determine if it is.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,430
If it meets those two
criteria, we should continue

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,720
with that project.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,170
If it doesn't, then we
probably shouldn't continue

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,730
and we should close the
project down instead.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,360
So let's look a little bit deeper

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,483
into continued business justification.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,340
First, the project must
always remain desirable,

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,190
viable, and achievable.

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,450
Let's break that down.

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,210
What's desirable mean?

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,770
Well, if a project is desirable
it's asking the question,

19
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,270
are there going to be
positive balance of benefits,

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,010
costs, and risks.

21
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,430
Are we going to get more
good out of this project than

22
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,900
the money or resources
it's going to cost us,

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,323
or the risk that it puts
our organization into.

24
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,350
Next, we want to look at viable.

25
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,000
Is the project going to be viable?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,850
That asks the question
can the organization have

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,820
the capability to deliver those products.

28
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,960
So if I take my organization for example,

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,330
we're an online training business.

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,110
Students pay us for us to teach them

31
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,630
how to pass an exam.

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,770
That's something that we're
good at and we can do,

33
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,840
we have the capability to do that.

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,080
But, if somebody tried to hire
us to go build a skyscraper,

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,970
I would have to turn that project down.

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,530
Because it's not what I'm good at,

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,480
it's not what I'm designed to do.

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,360
It's not viable for my company to do that.

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,410
And so that wouldn't be a good fit for us.

40
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,980
So your project should
always remain desirable,

41
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,100
viable, and thirdly, achievable.

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,890
So when we talk about a
project being achievable

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,470
we're really asking, will
the use of the project's

44
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,360
products result in the
outcomes and benefits

45
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,720
that are expected?

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,270
Now you may be wondering,
why is there an Olympic logo

47
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,600
here on the screen.

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,860
Well, the Olympics is
an example of a project

49
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,260
and it happens every four years.

50
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,330
The Olympics were put
together so that countries

51
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,600
could come together into
a neutral area and compete

52
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,320
on the sports field.

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,060
And so we could see
who's the fastest runner,

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,583
or the fastest swimmer, or
the best basketball player.

55
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,040
And it allows all the
countries to come together

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,960
to do somethings that's
competitive but not threatening,

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,570
like a war might be.

58
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,060
The outcome of that is supposed
to be good will towards

59
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,320
our fellow man, now, does
that project achieve that?

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,465
Is it worth all the
money to get the outcome

61
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:25,580
of those Olympic games?

62
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,490
Well, apparently the Olympic
Games Committee believes it is

63
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,040
because they keep funding
it every four years

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,700
and continue to do that.

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,390
So, for them, it's something
that they think is achievable.

66
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,080
The outcome of that
project, the games themself,

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,877
brings entertainment and joy
to millions around the world.

68
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:45,060
Now, when I look at continued
business justification

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,530
we have to ask the question, what do we do

70
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,160
if we aren't going to have
a project that's desirable,

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,030
viable, and achievable?

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,180
And notice when we talk
about continued business

73
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,687
justification, we're talking about this in

74
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:57,846
a continuous manner.

75
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,810
Throughout the project not
just to start the project

76
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,310
because to start it, obviously
we think it's desirable,

77
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,740
viable, and achievable.

78
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,890
But, if we get six months
down the road in this project

79
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,907
and we still aren't on track
to finish it we may go,

80
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:12,407
"It's no longer desirable,
viable, or achievable,

81
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:15,150
"and instead we're going
to close the project."

82
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,370
My aunt is a realtor down in Florida,

83
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,977
and back in 2008, 2009, 2010
timeframe, there were a lot

84
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:25,261
of houses that were
being left half finished

85
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:26,660
just like this because those neighborhoods

86
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,600
and those subdivisions
that were being built,

87
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,520
they realized that it
was no longer a desirable

88
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,150
or viable project for them.

89
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,680
Because, the housing market dried up.

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,650
There wasn't enough money
and enough buyers to buy

91
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,640
these new houses that were
being built on speculation.

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,690
And so a lot of construction just stopped

93
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,440
and houses sat there
like this for six months,

94
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,030
twelve months, years at a time.

95
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,970
And now, in 2018, a lot
of that inventory has been

96
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,730
bought up and has been resold.

97
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,900
But back then you would
see lots of neighborhoods

98
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,110
that just sat there, half
finished like this house

99
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,200
on the screen because those projects,

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,450
they simply closed them.

101
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,220
They left them where
they were and decided,

102
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,190
were not going to put
anymore money down this road

103
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,270
because we're not going to see
a return on that investment.

104
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,557
Now, another thing we look when we look

105
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:14,060
at continued business
justification is the return

106
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,570
on investment, like I
was just talking about.

107
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,770
This is going to prevent
us from wasting resources

108
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,510
on a project that has no benefit.

109
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,000
But I want to caution you,
benefits are not only monetary.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,090
There are other things out there.

111
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,010
So, you may be doing something
that is going to give goodwill

112
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,930
towards your company, or a
better brand recognition,

113
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,630
or something else of
value to your company.

114
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,900
It doesn't necessarily
have to be that I put

115
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,550
a hundred dollars in to
get two hundred dollars out

116
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,010
in return on investment.

117
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,450
I may put a hundred dollars
in so that I have more

118
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,490
brand recognition and that
may be more important to me.

119
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,250
So, whatever that project is,

120
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,580
you're going to define that in
your business case, up front,

121
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,450
so you know what the end
output is supposed to be.

122
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,420
And if you're going to
be on track to meet that,

123
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,410
the project will be continued.

124
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,490
And that brings us to the
concept of a business case.

125
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,810
I just mentioned that
before you start a project,

126
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,090
you have to have a valid business case.

127
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,300
That way you can see if you can have a

128
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,000
continued business
justification by comparing

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it back to this business case.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,490
Now a business case is a
product that is developed

131
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,730
to provide the justification.

132
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,610
It also is a theme, and we'll
talk about it in the theme

133
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,180
section as well.

134
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,380
An initial business case is an outline

135
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,940
that's developed during
the pre-project phase

136
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,090
to determine if the project
should even be initiated.

137
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,647
So, some executive has
a great idea and says,

138
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:36,130
"You know what, we should build an app."

139
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,870
So they go ahead and build
a justification for that

140
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,150
in a business case.

141
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,727
They'll say, "Well, we're
going to build an app,

142
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:44,207
"and it's going to do
one, two, three functions

143
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,817
"it's going to cost us x-amount of dollars

144
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:48,960
"and take us y-amount of time."

145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,390
And they'll present that to
try to get funding for it

146
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,410
so they can move forward
and initiate the project.

147
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,350
This, then would be fully developed during

148
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,870
the initiation stage.

149
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,547
So, once the CEO or the
head leadership goes,

150
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,007
"Yes, I think building
an app is a great idea,

151
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,710
"I approve of your business case,"

152
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,740
they then, will flush that out further

153
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,820
and give more details during
that initiation stage.

154
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,960
And this will also be continually updated

155
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,540
throughout the project to make
sure it continually remains

156
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,770
viable and achievable as we
work through the project.

157
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,170
So, do I need a business
case for everything?

158
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,570
Well, yes.

159
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,300
You need a business case
even if your project is

160
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,280
compulsory, regulatory, or
required by some executive.

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,580
You still are going to create
a business case because

162
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,250
it gives justification to your project

163
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,110
and throughout the project
we're going to go back

164
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,350
and compare it against
the business case to make

165
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,500
sure that it still remains
achievable and viable.

166
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,810
There's always more than
one way to solve a problem,

167
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,370
and therefore, you're going to give your

168
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,130
executives some choices.

169
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,600
And we usually call
those, courses of action.

170
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,210
So I will come up with
two or three, or four ways

171
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,890
that I can solve a
problem and then we'll let

172
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,530
management decide which
way we're going to go

173
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,370
by using this business case.

174
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,900
So let me give you an example.

175
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,570
Let's say my company decided
we wanted a way to test

176
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,270
students and see if they're
retaining the information.

177
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,890
Well I can do that by
providing an online quiz,

178
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,600
or I can use an online survey,

179
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,240
or I can give you a PDF
that you can download

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,170
and fill out and then Email back to me.

181
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,820
There's lots of ways to do it.

182
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,310
But I'm going to come up
with a business case of,

183
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,847
I'm going to build an app
for iPhones that's going to

184
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:26,120
allow you to do that quiz.

185
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Right, I now have to justify
how much it's going to cost.

186
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,210
What the timing is, and
if it's actually going to

187
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,030
have value for my customer.

188
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,570
And if it doesn't, we
wouldn't do it, right?

189
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,490
That's the idea of a business case.

190
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,470
So what kinds of things
are covered inside of a

191
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,580
business case?

192
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,172
Well, a business case
has six key components.

193
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,340
There's the reason for the project,

194
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,120
why are we going to do this?

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
In the case of my app, I want
students to be able to take

196
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,480
practice exams and see how they're doing.

197
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,870
Expected benefits and dis-benefits.

198
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,730
What does that mean?

199
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,440
Well, there's good things that happen,

200
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,560
those are the benefits.

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,080
But, there's bad things that happen.

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,610
Those are dis-benefits.

203
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,250
What threshold would make you want

204
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,010
to terminate the project?

205
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,810
Every project has good
things and bad things

206
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,240
and you have to figure out what those are.

207
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,520
And you'll list them
in your business case.

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,030
You'll also have a timeline,
the cost, and risks

209
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,740
associated with the project.

210
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,630
You'll have underlying assumptions.

211
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,760
So, if I'm doing an app
for instance, I may make

212
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,880
the underlying assumption
that 75% of my customers

213
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,330
use iPhones, and therefore,
we should release

214
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,360
an iPhone version first.

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,703
Now, that's an assumption.

216
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,730
It may be completely wrong,
and if we start launching it

217
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,550
and we see, whoa, we're
not getting the traction

218
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,600
we thought we were going
to, maybe it's because

219
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
one of my assumptions was wrong.

220
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,090
There also has to be options considered.

221
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,947
So, I might say, "We're
going to do this project

222
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,837
"and we're going to do iPhones first,

223
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,857
"but we also thought about doing Android

224
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,327
"and we also thought about doing Windows

225
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,647
"and we also thought about
doing a web-based version,"

226
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:53,060
"but we went with iPhone
because of x, y, and z reasons."

227
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,200
That's what we're going to
cover here in the business case.

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,660
And then we're going to give
them the chosen solution.

229
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,080
In my case, we went with
iPhone first because

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,478
we decided that was where we thought
75% of our customers were.

231
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,130
So you can see how this business case

232
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,294
starts coming together and
when you put it all together

233
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:10,240
here early in the stage,
it's just an outline.

234
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,310
It's very, very short.

235
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,300
Just a couple of pages usually.

236
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,960
But again, that's going to be
dependent on your organization

237
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,530
and the way that they like
to get their business cases.

238
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,878
