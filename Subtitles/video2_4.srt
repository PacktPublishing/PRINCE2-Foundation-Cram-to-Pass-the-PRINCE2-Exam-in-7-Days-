1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,050
- Defined roles and responsibilities.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,230
This is a really important principle

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,750
because it's going to ask the question:

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,010
Does everyone know what
is expected of them?

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,200
Now this is critical
because if I don't know

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,040
what's expected of me,
how can I do my job?

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,220
And that's what defined roles and

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,580
responsibilities is all about.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,680
It's going to ensure that
everyone in the project

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,100
knows exactly what role
they're fulfilling,

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,010
and the responsibilities associated

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,390
with that role.

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,760
It's also going to provide them with a

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,740
term of reference and role descriptions

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,880
for every single team member.

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,970
So that if I tell you that your job

17
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,880
is the executive on this project,

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,240
you know what that means.

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,470
Or if I tell you you're
the senior supplier,

20
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,800
you know what that means.

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,170
We'll talk about each
of those roles later on.

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,990
Next we also want to ensure
that each team member

23
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,860
has the correct level of authority

24
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,350
to perform their role.

25
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,920
So I want to empower them
to make the decisions

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,620
at their level that they
should be able to make.

27
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,830
We'll talk about that
and another principle

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,210
called manage by exception.

29
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,270
We also want to ensure that each person

30
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,170
has ample time to dedicate to the project.

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,003
I don't know about you,

32
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,610
but I've been at work some days

33
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,080
and I have a million tasks to do.

34
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,810
And if someone says hey
I want you to take on

35
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,360
this new project.

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,670
I'm tapped out.

37
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,520
I don't have the capacity or the time

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,600
to dedicate to it.

39
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,690
So even if I want to do it and I say

40
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,740
yeah sure make me the
lead on that project.

41
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,720
That project's going to
fail because I don't have

42
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,980
ample time and resources to dedicate

43
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,080
to that project.

44
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,530
So you want to make sure you consider that

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,850
as you're defining who has which role

46
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,780
and which responsibility.

47
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,600
Now leadership leads to success.

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,020
What do I mean by that?

49
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,240
Well leadership is important.

50
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,830
And when we look at a
project the project manager

51
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,810
is leading that project.

52
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,280
Now how should the organization structure

53
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,210
be built?

54
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,840
Should it be vertical or horizontal?

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,170
When I talk about vertical
I'm talking more like

56
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,160
what you see on the left of the screen,

57
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,880
where there's somebody
at the top of the pyramid

58
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,080
and then it kind of flows down from there.

59
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,870
When we talk about horizontal it's more

60
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,730
everybody is going to talk to each other

61
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,530
and to the center project manager

62
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,340
as shown on the right.

63
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,140
Teams are going to be
cross-functional in nature

64
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,550
and everyday organizational structures

65
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,150
usually just don't work.

66
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,390
Because in a project
it's much more based on

67
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,400
relationships than it is on a

68
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,810
strict organizational hierarchy.

69
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,010
So the project manager
is going to be able to

70
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,940
decide how they want to structure

71
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,350
the organization of that project.

72
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,300
Because PRINCE2 doesn't tell you

73
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,670
one way or the other.

74
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,640
There's only a couple of key places

75
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,020
in organization that
PRINCE2 is going to tell you

76
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,100
what you have to do.

77
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,280
And that is a very small vertical part

78
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,780
at the top of the organization.

79
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,240
So when we look at that we have

80
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
these management levels.

81
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,390
This is the management hierarchy

82
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,940
that PRINCE2 recommends.

83
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,490
You have a project board that

84
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,180
is at very very top and under them

85
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,300
you're going to have a project manager.

86
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,680
And that project manager has

87
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,450
team managers underneath them.

88
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,430
And so on the screen here you can see

89
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,540
the project board is currently directing

90
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,590
three different projects with a

91
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,850
project manager in charge of each one.

92
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,490
And each of those project managers

93
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,750
has three teams underneath
them working for them.

94
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,680
This is the management hierarchy

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,830
that is recommended by PRINCE2.

96
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,000
So it is very vertical in nature

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,150
but as a project manager you get to decide

98
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,050
what your organization
is going to look like

99
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,160
underneath you.

100
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,480
What that team looks like.

101
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,250
What the team management looks like.

102
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,000
And what your project looks like.

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,410
Only the project board and the

104
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,300
project manager level is really

105
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,613
what's defined by PRINCE2.

106
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,560
Now when we talk about the project board,

107
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,130
the project board is
made up of three people.

108
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,087
It's made up of the executive,

109
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:41,040
the senior user and the senior supplier.

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
Now I probably shouldn't
have said three people,

111
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,770
but it's three roles.

112
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,670
There can be multiple
people filling these roles,

113
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,860
with the exception of the executive.

114
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,510
When I talk about the executive

115
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,060
this is the person who's appointed

116
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,600
by the corporation or
by program management

117
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,190
to oversee the project board.

118
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,780
There is only one person who can

119
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,300
be the executive where the other two roles

120
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,890
you can have one or more people

121
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,160
filling those roles.

122
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,730
But the executive he is a singular person

123
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,530
and he has to be that way because

124
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,380
they're going to act as the decision-maker

125
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,460
and have the overall responsibility

126
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,670
for this project that the project board

127
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,060
is overseeing.

128
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,020
They are going to be the one who develop

129
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,730
and own the business case from the outline

130
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,520
all the way through the execution

131
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,290
of this project.

132
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,790
Now a project board is not a democracy.

133
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,890
Each of the other two
roles the senior user

134
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,270
and the senior supplier are

135
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,950
going to make recommendations,

136
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,910
but the executive really
does have the final say.

137
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,470
Because they're the one who is

138
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,850
responsible for this
project and it's success.

139
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,150
Now the senior user is
a role that can be held

140
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,090
by one or more people.

141
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,100
If you're dealing with a small project

142
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,420
the executive can actually

143
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,820
fill this role as well.

144
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,650
Cause if you remember
we talked about PRINCE2

145
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,310
being very tailorable to your environment.

146
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,240
It's a large project you may have

147
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,070
multiple senior users.

148
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,080
If it's a small project you may have

149
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,320
no senior users except for the executive.

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,700
Now this role is representing the needs

151
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,420
of the end user who's
going to use the product

152
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,850
that this project is putting out.

153
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,550
This is a liaison between the project team

154
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,130
and the users.

155
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,120
Now when I use the word project team

156
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,280
that's talking about the project board,

157
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,790
these three roles as well
as the project manager.

158
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,530
Those four people together those four

159
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,670
roles together make up the project team.

160
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,640
Now the senior user is going to supply

161
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,660
the benefits review plan.

162
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
And in the benefits review
plan it's going to say

163
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,470
these are all the good things we think

164
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,600
that this product is going to do for us.

165
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,700
For example, let's say I wanted to have

166
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,140
an automated log analysis program created.

167
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,250
The benefit for that may
be it's going to save me

168
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,820
hundreds of man hours who are

169
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,320
currently looking through logs.

170
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,640
It's going to identify issues faster.

171
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,630
It's going to solve
problems for me, right?

172
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,480
And it'd be a lot more defined than this,

173
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,650
but you get the idea.

174
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,040
What is it that this program, this app,

175
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,070
this thing, this house that we're building

176
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,600
what are the benefits of it?

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,390
In the case of a house
it's going to provide

178
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,390
shelter for somebody.

179
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,770
And it's going to have three
bedrooms and two baths.

180
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,590
It's going to have tile
floors and it's going to have

181
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,790
dry wall that you can hang pictures on.

182
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,310
Whatever those things are,

183
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,810
the benefits review are
going to capture what are

184
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,610
those good things that
we're expecting to get

185
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,490
out of this project?

186
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,290
Now the senior supplier is another role

187
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,590
that can be held by one or more people.

188
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,880
And again in a small project the executive

189
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,260
can fill this role.

190
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,900
So you can see in a small project

191
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,210
we might have a project board of one,

192
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,920
just the executive.

193
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,790
Now this senior supplier is

194
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,590
going to represent the interests of those

195
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,330
who are designing,
developing and implementing

196
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,050
the project's product.

197
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,270
So if we're going back
to that app example,

198
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,210
the senior supplier may be the design team

199
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,880
who consists of the graphics team and the

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,870
programming team and the
app development team.

201
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,300
And this person would
represent their interest.

202
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,500
Just like the senior user is representing

203
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,620
the people who are going to use the app,

204
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,750
the senior supplier is representing those

205
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,500
who are building the app.

206
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,880
This is going to provide the supplier

207
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,860
resources for the project.

208
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,760
This is going to be things like people,

209
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,830
tools and expertise.

210
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,350
That's why I said earlier that as

211
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,800
the IT director I was actually a supplier

212
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,930
into many projects.

213
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,690
I gave them what they needed: the people,

214
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,700
the expertise, the server
space, the hardware,

215
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,140
the software, whatever those things were

216
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,230
I was supplying those
as the senior supplier.

217
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,260
Now the senior supplier can come from

218
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,060
within the organization
like a purchasing manager

219
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,370
or the IT director or
it can come from outside

220
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,680
the organization from
the supplier themself.

221
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,300
And this is really common
if you're dealing with

222
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,780
a building project.

223
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,970
So let's say you were going to build

224
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,550
a new office building.

225
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,640
Well there's a lot of different

226
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,260
suppliers you're going to use.

227
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,330
You're going to have
somebody who's going to

228
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,730
build the office building.

229
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,880
You're going to have somebody
who's going to come in

230
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,410
and outfit all the wiring
for the server room.

231
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,243
You're going to have somebody else

232
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,940
who's going to come in
and do all the power.

233
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Another person's going to come and do

234
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
all the cooling.

235
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,100
And so you may have representatives

236
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,200
from each of those organizations

237
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,890
each of those suppliers
in your project board

238
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,523
if it's a large enough project.

239
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,960
Now stakeholders.

240
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,700
This is the last person.

241
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,690
And they're not necessarily
on the project board,

242
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,307
but they are represented inside of

243
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:19,710
the project board.

244
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,660
Now what does that mean?

245
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,860
Well the business, the
users and the suppliers

246
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
all have interests that
are being represented

247
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,270
on the project board.

248
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,450
Those are all stakeholders.

249
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,560
PRINCE2 assumes a
customer-supplier relationship.

250
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,330
And when we talk about
who the customer is,

251
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,300
we're really talking about an individual,

252
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,660
a group, or an organization who has

253
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,060
a business need.

254
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,010
So they want to be able
to increase their profits,

255
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,230
they want to cut their
cost, they want to build

256
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,450
a widget or they have some other need.

257
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,810
That's our end customer.

258
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,550
The project is going to build something

259
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,170
for that customer.

260
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,920
So who are the stakeholders?

261
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,270
Those who are building it,

262
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,590
those who are using it,

263
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,610
and those who are dealing with

264
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,190
this project overall.

265
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,450
All of these are stakeholders who

266
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,300
are going to have some
say into the final project

267
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,250
and the final output of that project.

268
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,750
(music tones)
