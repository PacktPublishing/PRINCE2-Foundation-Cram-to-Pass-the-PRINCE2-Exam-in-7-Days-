1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,290
- Starting up a project.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,830
So when we start up a project,
we are trying to ensure

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,820
that the prerequisites for
initiating this project

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,390
are in place by answering
one simple question.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,980
Do we have a viable
and worthwhile project?

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,380
And that's really important,
because as you look at

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,500
our process timeline here,
you will see that starting up

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,850
a project occurs in the pre-project phase.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,800
This is the cheapest
place for this to occur.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,680
We start with this starting up a project

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,200
to determine is it worthwhile
to start dedicating the time,

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,970
the money, the man
hours, and the resources

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,400
into this project.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,610
And so, we're going to
start way early here

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,440
and determine if we
should even move forward.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,730
Now, as we look at the
objectives of starting up

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,220
a project, the first
couple things we have to do

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,510
is get some man hours behind it.

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,890
We need to appoint those
who are going to work on it

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,810
during the initiation stage.

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,650
Now at this point, we haven't decided

22
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,890
if this is a worthwhile project yet,

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,730
we are just going to put in
minimal hours and minimal manpower

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,000
to determine if it's a good idea.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,260
We're going to appoint significant
project management roles,

26
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,710
so people like the executive
should be defined right now.

27
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,800
And the reason why, is the
executive has to be the one

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,300
to show that this good idea
is going to make a worthwhile

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,590
business case for us to implement.

30
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,820
We also need to create
an initiation stage plan,

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,140
and we do that once we get later into the

32
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,710
starting up a project phase
because we've determined

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,590
that it may be a good idea
and we should move forward.

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,750
And the initiation stage is
based on sound assumptions.

35
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,610
We have to define things like
the scope of the project,

36
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,110
how long it's going to
take or the timescale,

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,680
the acceptance criteria, What
will the finished product

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,670
look like that people would like,

39
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,410
and the constraints.

40
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,490
What are we going to say
are the limitations around

41
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,410
this project?

42
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,110
Maybe we have a limitation
that we're not going to spend

43
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,550
more than 100 manhours or 100,000 dollars,

44
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,770
or whatever it is.

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,970
Those constraints have
to be known up front

46
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,170
so we can decide is
this project worthwhile.

47
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,270
And all of that starts
with this project mandate.

48
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,580
Now our goal here is simple.

49
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,500
We want to take the hundreds
of ideas that come up

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,900
in a daily meeting, and
decide which one is the one

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,240
viable project idea that we
should move forward with.

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,480
Because I don't know about you,

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,380
but when I go to meetings and
we have a brainstorming meeting,

54
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,240
people throw all sorts
of crazy ideas up, right?

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,280
That's kind of the
purpose of brainstorming.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,930
But you might have 50,
or 100, or 200 ideas,

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,720
but you only have enough
resources to implement one or two

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,553
of them.

59
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,210
So we want to only initiate the project

60
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,720
that might be successful
and discard all of the rest

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,810
before we waste a lot of
time, money, and resources.

62
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,340
So just as you see here on the screen,

63
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,270
I have five different ideas,
but only one is going to

64
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,260
turn into that end product.

65
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,940
And that's the goal here
with starting up a project.

66
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,670
And we do that by starting with a mandate.

67
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,740
The project mandate is your
trigger for the project.

68
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,080
This comes from the
customer's organization,

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,750
and it can come from their
corporate, program management

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,570
office or from the customer themself.

71
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,550
They can just say, you
know, it'd be really great

72
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,170
if I had X product, and now
you've got a project mandate

73
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,370
to work with, right?

74
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,480
This is going to provide
the reason for undertaking

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,070
the project and it's going to
identify the proposed executive.

76
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,520
At this point, when you
get a project mandate,

77
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,950
this says I think it'd be a
great idea if we had a new

78
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,540
travel system, and I'm
going to dictate that Jason

79
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,420
is going to be the executive for it.

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,260
That's pretty much as
deep as you might get on

81
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,350
a project mandate.

82
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,110
If you're lucky, they may
give you a one or two page

83
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,440
description of what they think
this travel system will be.

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,320
But you're not always that lucky.

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,660
Sometimes it's as easy,
and a small project,

86
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,720
as somebody going I have this idea,

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,660
go forth and conquer, right?

88
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,750
If it's a large project,
it'll be a little bit more

89
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,583
formalized.

90
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,500
But once you get this project mandate,

91
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,790
that's what's going to
trigger the starting up a

92
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,250
project phase, or process,

93
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,890
that we're going to work through here.

94
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,730
Now, when you're inside the
starting up a project process,

95
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,520
you have a couple of requirements.

96
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,630
You have to identify key
roles and responsibilities

97
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,030
for who is going to take this
thing forward if it's greenlit.

98
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,383
If someone says go into the next stage,

99
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,870
which is the initiation stage,
who's going to do that work?

100
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,270
So that's identifying those
key board members, right?

101
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,750
And who's going to be the project
manager and things like that.

102
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,220
You're also going to have
to allocate resources.

103
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,840
So if it gets beyond a project mandate,

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,000
and you are told to start up the project,

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,590
somebody's got to fund it because
this is going to start taking

106
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,690
man hours, it's going
to start taking money,

107
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,867
it's going to start taking equipment,

108
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,900
and it's going to start taking time.

109
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,370
And you have to identify who's
going to write the business

110
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,410
case and the project plan.

111
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,906
Normally, this is going
to be your project manager

112
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,780
or your executive.

113
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,040
Remember, the executive is
responsible for the business case

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
but it doesn't mean
they're going to be the one

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,300
sitting down to write it.

116
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,310
Now, when we talk about the business case,

117
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,820
this is going to explain
how the project fits

118
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,460
into the customer's objectives

119
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,600
and how it's going to be funded.

120
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,850
The executive is responsible
for securing that funding.

121
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,550
So this is their baby, they
have to champion for it.

122
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,810
They have to convince the
stakeholders and the customers

123
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,030
and the suppliers that they
should all get on board

124
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,863
with this.

125
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,860
And the executive is
responsible for creating

126
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
the outline of that business case,

127
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,420
and then they can turn
that over to somebody else

128
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,850
to write the full business case for them.

129
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,840
Now, the outputs of
this stage are two-fold.

130
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,950
You have to have a project brief.

131
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,580
This is going to ensure the
project has the agreed upon

132
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,400
and well defined starting point.

133
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,100
So everybody knows what
your end product is going to

134
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,933
look like.

135
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,440
And you're going to brief that
to those key stakeholders.

136
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,712
You're also going to have to
create an initiation stage plan.

137
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,960
Remember, we don't need the
entire project planned out yet.

138
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,180
We just need the next stage.

139
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,360
So we're going to do that with
the initiation stage plan.

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,430
This is going to cover all the
work that's going to be done

141
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,610
in the initiation stage,
which we'll talk about

142
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,880
in the next lesson.

143
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,190
As well as the project
manager is going to review

144
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,100
the lessons log for
projects that look similar,

145
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,960
so that they can use those
controls inside of the

146
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,690
initiation stage itself, as well.

147
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,420
Now, that is what we're talking
about when we talk about

148
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,530
starting up a project.

149
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,440
In the next lesson,
we're going to talk about

150
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,840
directing a project.

151
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,163
And then, we're going to move
into the initiation stage.
