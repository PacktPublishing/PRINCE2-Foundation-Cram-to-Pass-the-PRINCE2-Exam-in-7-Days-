1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:02,496
- The business case.

2
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:04,420
So the first theme we're
going to talk about

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,459
here in PRINCE2 is the business case.

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:10,593
What is a business case,
well it's a document

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,901
and this document is going to
help us to put systems into place

6
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,113
that will assist the decision maker

7
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:19,999
in determining if a project
is worthwhile or not.

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:23,198
It really comes down to letting
the executive make a case

9
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:26,851
for why we should go
forward with this project.

10
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:29,252
This is going to be
implementing the principle

11
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:31,809
of continued business justification.

12
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:33,539
So as we mentioned in the last lesson,

13
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,416
each of these themes
is going to be reliant

14
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,859
upon implementing those principles.

15
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,320
And later these themes are
going to be implemented

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,483
through the processes,
and so you could see

17
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:46,569
how PRINCE2 starts building upon itself.

18
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:50,209
Now, how many business cases
are there for a project?

19
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,358
Well, there really is going to be two.

20
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:53,947
There's going to be one for the customer

21
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:57,392
and one for the supplier,
because each comes at a project

22
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:01,024
with a different vantage point
and a different perspective.

23
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,582
And they have to convince their bosses

24
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,638
that they should undertake this project.

25
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:07,153
And remember, PRINCE2 always assumes

26
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,871
a Customer Supplier Relationship.

27
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,833
Now, the customer is going
to specify the products

28
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,449
that they're going to be
required for this project.

29
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,973
They're going to pay for the project

30
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:20,217
and they're going to expect to
receive some sort of benefit

31
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:22,434
by the time this project is over.

32
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:23,901
The supplier on the other hand

33
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,215
is the person, the team,
or the organization

34
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,347
that is going to deliver those products

35
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:31,866
to market under the agreed
upon level of quality.

36
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,735
So if I wanted to build a
website, I may be the customer

37
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:38,223
and I need to hire a
supplier to build it for me.

38
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,849
That supplier has to determine,

39
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,074
is it in their best interest to build it?

40
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:43,858
And that best interest may be defined

41
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:45,850
by how much money they're
going to charge me,

42
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,565
or how long it's going to take them,

43
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,373
or will they get more
business in the future?

44
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:50,938
They're going to have to determine

45
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,500
whether it's worth it or not to them,

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,816
just like I need to determine

47
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:55,356
whether or not it's worth it to me

48
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:58,835
as a customer to pay for this
and to get these products.

49
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,266
So the business case is a document,

50
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:04,482
and this document is
owned by the executive.

51
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:07,133
This is one of the PRINCE2
management products

52
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,662
that are going to be produced

53
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,611
throughout the processes of PRINCE2.

54
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:15,452
An acceptable business case
has to exist at all times,

55
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:18,910
otherwise the executive
should close down the project

56
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,754
because it's not going to
get you the benefits you want

57
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:24,750
because again you're
balancing time, and resources,

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,824
and quality, and money,
and all of these things.

59
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,305
And if there's not going to be
a big enough bang for your buck

60
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,095
you should terminate the project.

61
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,594
Now, when you're trying
to decide as an executive

62
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,591
whether or not you should continue forward

63
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,629
with the project, you should always do it

64
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,799
with a sunk cost analysis.

65
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,755
And what I mean by that
is, you need to determine

66
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:46,693
whether or not to move
forward, without really relying

67
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:49,516
on looking back of how
much you've already spent.

68
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,683
Because that is a way to blind yourself

69
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,694
into making bad decisions.

70
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,454
If you've ever played in a poker game

71
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:57,052
like you see here on the screen

72
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,316
you may have found
yourself in this position.

73
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:01,998
You put in your blind of five chips

74
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:05,180
and then you put in your call of 10 chips,

75
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,640
and then the round of betting happens

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,195
and you put in another 50 chips.

77
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:10,670
And now you're at the last
bet and somebody raises you

78
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,930
and you know you don't
have that good of a hand,

79
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,866
but you're like "Well, I
already put in 65 chips.

80
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,120
"I feel like I have to go forward."

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,950
And they call that pot committed.

82
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,967
Well, if you're using a sunk cost analysis

83
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,042
you would not even consider the fact

84
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:27,231
that you've already spent 65
chips to get to this point.

85
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:29,438
You would only look at the
point you're currently at

86
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,081
and whether or not it makes
sense to continue on forward.

87
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,759
That's the idea of a sunk cost analysis.

88
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,040
And so, when you're doing
these business cases

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,437
and you're determining
whether to go or no go

90
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:43,767
to the next stage, always use
a sunk cost analysis approach.

91
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,080
Ignore what you've already
put into the project,

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,351
only think about what more you're going

93
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:50,829
to have to put into the
project to get it on track

94
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,974
and get the products out that you need.

95
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:53,960
And if that's too much,

96
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,760
then you're going to terminate the project

97
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,717
Now, when you look at the business case

98
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:00,863
the first business case
you get in a project

99
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:04,102
is actually only going to be a
draft, it's going to be an outline.

100
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:07,167
And the executive again
should be the one producing

101
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,874
this initial business outline.

102
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,718
In some organizations that's
actually maybe handled

103
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,797
by your corporate or program
management board instead.

104
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,607
And they would provide the
outline to the executive

105
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,710
to charge them with this project.

106
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,384
So for example, if I
wanted to build an app

107
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,461
like I've used that example before, I may

108
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,440
as the program management
come up with an outline

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,257
of what I think the app should do

110
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:31,064
and roughly what I think it may cost.

111
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,403
And give it to an
executive to start working

112
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,606
on that project and move forward.

113
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,640
But once I turn it over to the executive

114
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,508
they own it from that point out.

115
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:42,262
Now, that initial first draft
outline of a business case

116
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:45,567
is then going to be updated
with additional levels of detail

117
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,765
as we go into the initiation
stage of the project.

118
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:52,130
To initiate a project and
get into the initiation stage

119
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,432
we only need an outline, but to get out of

120
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:58,212
that initiation stage we do
need a complete business case.

121
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:00,366
And the business case is
also going to be updated

122
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,140
at every stage boundary
because we have to make

123
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,108
a go/no go determination on
whether we're going to move

124
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:09,751
into the next stage, or
terminate the project.

125
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,675
Now, we're going to come up
with specialist products as well

126
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:14,750
as part of this business case.

127
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,246
These specialist products are the outputs

128
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,528
that are going to be found
at the end of the project

129
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,636
by the users in the
customer's organization.

130
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,804
So these products should
positively change the way

131
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,562
that users conduct
their business as usual.

132
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,385
So if they're normally used
to filing things one way

133
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:33,341
and we build a new filing system

134
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,109
it should be a better filing system

135
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,218
than the current way
they're doing business.

136
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:39,644
And that would have
them realize a benefit.

137
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:42,957
The change that's going to
occur here is called an outcome.

138
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:46,421
And any benefits are
measurable improvements

139
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,963
and those would be
different types of outcomes

140
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:51,710
as a result of this project.

141
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,148
Now, when I look at the benefits.

142
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:56,377
Let's look at an example
here, one project I worked on

143
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,453
was we built a travel approval system.

144
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,357
It was a very small project,
it only cost a couple

145
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:03,999
of hundred dollars, but
its a great example here

146
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,695
of giving benefits to end users.

147
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:08,311
When I first got to the organization

148
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,680
the way that they dealt
with their travel approval

149
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,647
was by routing manual paper copies.

150
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:16,481
So the person who wanted to
go and travel would go ahead

151
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,496
and fill out a form of
where they wanted to go

152
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:20,550
and they would look up the
cost for the airplanes,

153
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,280
and they'd look up the
cost for the hotels,

154
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,170
and the rental cars,
and all that information

155
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,664
and put it on a piece of paper.

156
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:26,579
And then they would go bring it

157
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,759
to their first level supervisor,

158
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,689
and they would sign off on it.

159
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,843
And then they'd walk down the hall

160
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,252
to the supervisor's supervisor

161
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:33,787
and get them to sign off on it.

162
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:36,213
And they had to do this through
five or six different levels

163
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,049
of approval and then get it to the person

164
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,755
who would book the tickets for them.

165
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,245
It was a very cumbersome system.

166
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:43,851
And when you wanted to go
through a travel process

167
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,622
it may eat up four or five or six hours

168
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,504
of your day trying to get approvals

169
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,328
and track down the right people.

170
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,817
So when I got there I was tasked

171
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:54,290
with building an automated
system to replace this.

172
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,350
And we did this using some workflows

173
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,927
and creativity through a website.

174
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:01,329
And it got to the point where
the person, the end user

175
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,133
was able to log on to this website

176
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,170
put in where they wanted to
go, how much it was going to be

177
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,104
and the system would
automatically route it

178
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:11,292
through email from person to
person to get those approvals.

179
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,061
And we were able to decrease the time

180
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:14,912
for approval from two to three days,

181
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,797
by having to track down all these people,

182
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,580
into just a couple of hours

183
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,709
by going through this automated process.

184
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,064
It was easier for the
end user, it was easier

185
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:25,679
for the supervisors,
and everyone loved it.

186
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,689
This is a really simple way
of showing what the end result

187
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,052
of this business case
and this project was.

188
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,290
Now when I was charged with this project

189
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,350
the corporate management
came to me and said,

190
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,369
"I know what I want, I want
an automated travel system."

191
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,679
So they already gave me the rough outline.

192
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,914
Then as the executive I had to go through

193
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,680
and build out my first draft of that,

194
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,624
get it into project initiation,

195
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,264
get it through execution stages,

196
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:51,510
and then close out the project
and deliver those benefits.

197
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,691
That's the idea here when
you talk about benefits.

198
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,352
In this case it was minimizing

199
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:59,315
the amount of time it took
to get travel approved.

200
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,896
Now when we look at benefits
the senior user role

201
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:05,358
is going to be the one responsible
for specifying the benefits

202
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,384
and ensuring that those are realized.

203
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:10,563
So in my case it was a very small project

204
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,212
so I served as both the executive,

205
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:14,843
the senior user, and the senior supplier

206
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,479
because I ran the IT organization.

207
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,849
And so, I had the role of all three.

208
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,921
And in my senior user role
I spoke to the end users

209
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,550
and said "what would make
this system work well for you,

210
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,448
"what do you want to realize?"

211
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:27,912
And the big things were
they didn't want to have

212
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:30,074
to leave their desks to
get approval for travel

213
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:33,045
by having to walk around
paper all day long

214
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,631
and they wanted to be quicker and easier.

215
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,812
So we took those pain points
and we found those benefits

216
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,992
and built a system that supported that.

217
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:43,067
The senior user is going
to come from the area

218
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,412
of the customer's organization

219
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:47,064
that's likely to be
impacted by those changes.

220
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,706
Now as one of the guys
who ran the IT department

221
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,431
I actually traveled a lot.

222
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,183
And so I was one of these users
that was feeling this pain.

223
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,077
And so it was very easy for me

224
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,843
to capture those user requirements

225
00:08:57,843 --> 00:09:01,211
because I was an end user
of this project as well.

226
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,106
But if you're not, you need to go

227
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:05,142
and get somebody from that area.

228
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:07,055
If I was going to build
an accounting system,

229
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:09,373
I'm not an accountant, I
would want to embed one of

230
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,768
those people on my team to make
sure that we're going to get

231
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,679
the benefits needed for
that area of expertise.

232
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,997
So the next thing we have is what's called

233
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,320
the benefits management approach.

234
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,054
And the benefits management
approach is a document,

235
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,493
it's one of the PRINCE2
management products

236
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:27,058
that's going to be created
through the project.

237
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,127
This is going to document how the benefits

238
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,044
will be measured, when, and by who.

239
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,918
So in the example of my travel system

240
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,844
we said we were going
to measure the amount

241
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:38,228
of time it took to get something approved.

242
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:40,841
In the old system it may
take two or three days,

243
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:44,693
under the new system we had
a target of about four hours.

244
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,146
From the time somebody had submitted

245
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,205
their initial process
to the time it got back

246
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:50,502
and was approved and ready for purchase.

247
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,504
We said we wanted this done when,

248
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,122
we were measuring it weekly and by who,

249
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:57,330
we were measuring it by
our knowledge management

250
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,241
and information management team to see

251
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,597
if the system was working appropriately.

252
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:02,788
And that is the way we did our

253
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:05,417
benefits management approach
for this small project.

254
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:08,124
Now this is updated when
the benefits are realized.

255
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:09,768
So once the product was delivered

256
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:12,915
we then went back and said "Okay
we said we were going to do it

257
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,239
"to a four hour window,
we're going to do it weekly,

258
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,900
and we're going to do it by
the knowledge management,

259
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,851
"information management
team, is that still correct?"

260
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,260
And once we delivered the product

261
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,900
and turned it over to
operations they started seeing,

262
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,759
yeah once a week was good, doing it

263
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,419
for four hours was good,
but they didn't think

264
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,343
the knowledge management or
information management team

265
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:32,440
should be the ones measuring it.

266
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,840
So instead this was
turned over to procurement

267
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,940
because they were the
ones buying the tickets.

268
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,883
And they got those tickets, they could see

269
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,016
when the thing was put in as a request,

270
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,969
and when the ticket was actually bought.

271
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,716
So it's easier for them to measure it.

272
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:47,410
And we updated that when
the project was closed

273
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,019
which is very, very common
because that's when it's

274
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,684
going from the transition of
building it into operations.

275
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:56,748
And it's a different team
that will be measuring it.

276
00:10:56,748 --> 00:11:00,045
Now let's summarize this
whole business case theme up.

277
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:02,020
There are three minimum requirements

278
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,166
that you have to do inside
of the business case theme.

279
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,436
The first is you have to define
roles and responsibilities

280
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:11,530
for the business case and the
benefits management approach.

281
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,511
Who's going to write them

282
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,975
and who's going to be responsible for them.

283
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,515
As a general rule, the
executive is responsible

284
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:20,609
for the business case and
the senior user is going to

285
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,015
be responsible for the
benefits management approach.

286
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,127
But it doesn't mean they're
going to write them,

287
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,939
it just means they're responsible
to make sure they get done.

288
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,047
Then, we're going to make sure that

289
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:31,784
a business case is created and maintained.

290
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:33,442
And finally, we need to make sure

291
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:37,541
a benefits management approach
is created and maintained.

292
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,846
If you get those three
things that is the minimum

293
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:43,846
that you need to fit the
theme of business case.
