00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,610
- Congratulations, you've made
it to the end of the course.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,070
Now, I know we've spent
a lot of time together

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,750
as we went this PRINCE2 Foundation

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,730
Cram to Pass video course.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,470
We've covered the seven
principles of PRINCE2;

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,360
those building blocks of
the PRINCE2 methodology,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,810
including: Continued
Business Justification,

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,980
Learn from Experience, Defined
Roles and Responsibilities,

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,650
Manage by Stages, Manage by Exception,

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,670
Focus on Products, and
Tailoring to the Environment.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,580
We then went into applying
those in our themes,

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,430
which are project
management areas that had

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,350
to continually be addressed
throughout our project,

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,260
that include: the Business
Case, Organization,

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,970
Quality, Plans, Risk,
Change, and Progress.

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,990
We then took those themes and principles

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,470
and made them grow legs and start working

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,730
for us inside of our processes.

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,180
This was where we described
the who, the what,

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,090
and the when of our project.

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,330
This was our Starting Up a
Project, Initiating a Project,

22
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,200
Directing a Project,
Controlling a Project,

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,260
Managing our Product Delivery,
Managing a Stage Boundary,

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,320
and Closing out a Project.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,870
Once we did all of that,
where do you go from here?

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,260
Well, you've already
watched all the videos,

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,740
and you've probably
already downloaded the pdf

28
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,770
with copies of all of
these slides to study from.

29
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,490
But, if you want to test if you're ready

30
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,600
for the final certification exam,

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,100
you should take the practice exams.

32
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,820
In this course, I have provided you

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,660
with two full-length practice exams

34
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,850
that give you 60 questions each.

35
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,240
When you take those exams,

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,327
if you're scoring 70% or higher,

37
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,860
you are ready to take

38
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,500
the PRINCE2 Foundation
Certification Exam for real.

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,510
Now, when you go through those exams,

40
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,340
anything you get wrong,
you're going to see

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,460
the correct answer and a reason

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,310
why the correct answer
was the correct answer.

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,190
I want you to go back and
learn from your mistakes,

44
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,500
so that you can get those
questions right the next time.

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,580
If you're looking for additional practice,

46
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,530
I do have six additional
full-length practice exams

47
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,210
available for you in our
Practice Exam Only course.

48
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,900
Now, I'm not trying to
sell you something here.

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,670
I'm just saying, if you're not doing well

50
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,600
on your practice exams,
take more practice exams.

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,740
That can be mine.

52
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,150
That can be some other instructor's.

53
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,160
It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,480
But, I want you to be ready come test day,

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,030
so you can take and pass your

56
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,340
PRINCE2 Foundation Exam
on your first attempt,

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,430
because it's pretty expensive to take.

58
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,870
And you don't want to have
to take it more than once.

59
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,490
Now, when you're ready to go take

60
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,550
that PRINCE2 Certification Exam,

61
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,450
you're going to go over to Peoplecert.org

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,200
to signup for the exam.

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,560
If you want to see how to do that,

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,010
I've created a video for you at the end

65
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,500
of this course that will walk you

66
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,380
through how to schedule
and signup for your exam.

67
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,940
And you can take it online

68
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,280
from the comfort of your own home.

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,950
So, with that said, I
want you to practice,

70
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,510
practice, practice, and
then go take that exam.

71
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,350
And let me know when you
become PRINCE2 certified.

72
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,260
I hope to see you in a future course,

73
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,373
and good luck.
