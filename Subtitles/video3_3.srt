1
00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:02,270
- Organization.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,850
The second theme we're going to talk about

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,940
here is organization.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,380
Now, when we talk about
organization this is how we're

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,080
going to define and set up a
project management team structure.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,960
And we're going to
dictate the accountability

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,610
and responsibility for this project.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,120
This is going to implement our
defined roles and responsibility

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,550
principle and really help
us get organized as we move

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,840
forward with the project.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,770
Because, as I said before,
if you don't clearly identify

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,650
people's roles and
responsibilities your project

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,590
is likely to fail.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,340
Now when we talk about PRINCE2 we've mentioned over

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,810
and over this is a customer
supplier environment.

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,380
The customer is the one
who specifies the result

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,560
of the project, which is
going to be your end product.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,250
They're going to pay for the
project and they're going to be

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,800
the ones realizing the
benefits from the project.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,620
Your suppliers are going
to be the people, the team,

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,430
and the organization that
is supplying the product

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,520
as requested by the customer.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,950
Now, if the work is conducted
within your own organization

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,380
your customer and supplier
can both be inside your

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,640
organization but maybe
from different departments.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,410
For example, if you're building
a website you may have the

27
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,190
web development team in IT
building the website to support

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,917
the customer who is your
sales and marketing team.

29
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,240
And you can see how this
customer supplier relationship

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,160
works inside the company as
well as if you went outside

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,650
the company for that web development.

32
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,850
Now when we look at the
project board, we have the

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,450
project board that is made up
of three key roles, and these

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,180
are your key decision makers.

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,670
This is your executive, your senior user,

36
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,890
and your senior supplier.

37
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,379
When we talk about the project
board itself this board is

38
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,640
the one who has the authority
to make the decisions to

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,880
approve your plans, approve
your deviations from your plans,

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,940
and approve the resources
needed for this project.

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,990
The project board should be no more than

42
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,220
five to seven people, because
as they get larger and larger

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,880
it gets harder to make decisions.

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,110
The executive has the deciding
vote on everything though,

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,990
because they're the ones
who have the responsibility

46
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,810
to do this work.

47
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,890
The executive makes the
decisions, but the senior user,

48
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,750
and senior supplier get
to inform and recommend

49
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,750
and provide advice to them.

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,300
Remember, the project
board is not a democracy.

51
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,450
It really is more of a
dictatorship, but it's

52
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,550
a benevolent dictatorship,
where the executive relies on

53
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,220
the advice and counsel of
other people on the boards

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,950
to make sure the project is successful.

55
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,180
Now, when we look at the
executive this is a role that is

56
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,720
performed by only one person.

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,760
You can't have multiple
people being the executive.

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,010
The executive is going to
represent the business.

59
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,590
They're going to represent
the customer who is paying

60
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,970
for this project.

61
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,340
So, if we go back to my web
design example, the executive

62
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,460
probably should be somebody
coming from sales and marketing.

63
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,370
Because they are going to be
the end user of that product,

64
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,970
and they're going to be the
ones who are paying for it.

65
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,550
They are responsible ultimately
for the project's success

66
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,840
or failure, and that's why
they get to make the decisions,

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,100
based on the advice of the senior user,

68
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,930
and the senior supplier.

69
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,090
Now the senior user is
a role that specifies

70
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,020
and realizes the benefits.

71
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,670
What do we want out of this project?

72
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,070
So, again going back to our
web design example, this is

73
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,710
probably somebody from sales
and marketing, since they are

74
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,250
the ones who are going to be
using and providing service

75
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,170
to that website at the end.

76
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,110
They're responsible for ensuring
the project actually meets

77
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,540
the requirements and get
products out that are usable

78
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,960
and we can realize benefit from.

79
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
Now, when we look at our
senior supplier, they're

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,660
accountable for bringing
all the required skills

81
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,460
and resources to this project.

82
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,570
And so, they're responsible
for the project's quality.

83
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,330
Going back to my web design
example, the senior supplier

84
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,200
would be somebody from the
web development or IT team,

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,942
because they're the ones who
are providing the service

86
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:52,180
to our customer sales and marketing.

87
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,380
Kind of see all this
starts working together.

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,330
That's the idea here, but
having clear lines of roles

89
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,020
and responsibility makes
it easy to know who is

90
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,660
in charge of what thing,

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,910
and when something goes wrong
who are we going to blame?

92
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,290
So, there is this other role
out there called project

93
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,530
assurance, now the project
board is going to be telling

94
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,610
the project manager what to do,

95
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,560
based on approving their
plans the project manager's

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,510
going to go out and do that work.

97
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,040
Well project assurance is
there to make sure the project

98
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,300
manager does their job properly.

99
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,450
This role is used to assure
the project board, which is

100
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,450
the executive, the senior
user, and the senior supplier,

101
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,570
that the project is
being conducted properly.

102
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,358
This role cannot be held by
the project manager themselves

103
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,280
because that would be like
checking your own homework,

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,490
right, you need somebody else to check it.

105
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,010
And so, it can be held by a
project management board member,

106
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,230
like the senior user, the senior
supplier or the executive,

107
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,210
or it can be delegated down
to a third party person

108
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,980
within the organization.

109
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,320
This person is going to give
advice to the project manager

110
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,700
when needed and they're
going to review the documents

111
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,130
before they make their way
up to the project board.

112
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,220
They are that quality assurance
check inside of our project.

113
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,370
Now, the project manager, this
is the person doing the work.

114
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,090
This is the person responsible
for the day to day project

115
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,060
management activities, and
reporting progress back to

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,410
the project board.

117
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,630
So, they're going to create
the highlight report,

118
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,820
which we've talked about
before, and the exception report

119
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,950
when we go outside of tolerances.

120
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,300
Using these two reports, they're
going to feed information

121
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,990
up to the project board, so
they can decide whether or not

122
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,510
the project should continue
forward, or should be canceled,

123
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,030
but again, before those reports
go up, they're going to go

124
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,810
through project assurance to
make sure the project manager

125
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,500
isn't hiding anything.

126
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,390
That's the whole idea here, is
making sure we have a system

127
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,372
of checks and balances so the
project goes successfully,

128
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:44,090
and no single person becomes that single

129
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,610
point of failure.

130
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,770
The team manager works for
the project manager, and there

131
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,760
may be multiple team managers.

132
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,600
These are the people who
manage teams of specialists,

133
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,810
with the required skills
to enable the design,

134
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,340
and production of a product
specified by the customer.

135
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,020
So, if we go back to my web
design example, there may be

136
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,920
a team who's working on
graphics, and another team who's

137
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,070
working on the code.

138
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,440
And another team that's working on the

139
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,090
servers and the infrastructure.

140
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,410
And all three of those will report up to

141
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,030
the project manager.

142
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,920
Now, these teams are responsible
for delivering products

143
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,940
on time and within tolerances,
based on the team plans

144
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,170
that they've been given
from the project manager.

145
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,110
They're going to be reporting
periodically back up to the

146
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,690
project manager who then
takes that information and

147
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,220
consolidates it in their reports.

148
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,870
Whether that's the highlight
report or the exception report

149
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,410
back up to the project board.

150
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,570
The next role we have is something called

151
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,330
the change authority.

152
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,730
Now the change authority
is responsible for making

153
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,060
decisions about requests
for change, rfc's and

154
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,160
off specification requests.

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,610
We're going to cover this more
in the change theme so for now

156
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,300
just think about the change
authority as the person who

157
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,280
can approve changes because
that's what they do.

158
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,730
Because any time you have a
change, that's usually going to

159
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,870
cost more money or it's
going to save some money.

160
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,350
And it's going to change the
requirements for the end product.

161
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,080
For example, if you were
building a house and you had

162
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,510
designed it as a three bedroom
two bath house, and now

163
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,740
the person who's house it is
comes and says, you know what

164
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,870
I changed my mind, now
I want three bedrooms

165
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,540
and three bathrooms.

166
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,680
Well, now that they want that
change you're going to have to

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,910
go through and make a bunch of
other changes to the project

168
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,870
to add that third bathroom.

169
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,440
Because that third bathroom
didn't exist before.

170
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,220
And if you put it in
you're going to lose space

171
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,270
from something else.

172
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,340
Maybe you're not going
to have a closet anymore.

173
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,670
But now you're going to need
additional plumbing, and that can

174
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,092
cost more or less money
depending on the change.

175
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,840
Somebody has to be the
approval authority for that

176
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,650
change in the project, and that's what the

177
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,562
change authority does.

178
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:47,460
Now, there's another role
that works underneath the

179
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,550
project manager that's an optional role,

180
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,660
and it's called project support.

181
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,850
This is someone who's going
to assist the project manager

182
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,930
and the team managers with
the daily administration,

183
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,100
report generation, progress monitoring,

184
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,040
and other necessary tasks.

185
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,460
If it's a small project you
may not have project support.

186
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,520
You as the project manager may be

187
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,560
the project support yourself.

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
If you're in a large project
though, you're probably going to

189
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,700
have somebody to help you,
because if you're in a large

190
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,247
project a single project
manager can't handle everything

191
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,900
by themselves, especially if
they're getting bogged down

192
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,640
in all those change requests,
all those exceptions, all

193
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,310
those highlight reports and
everything else they need to do.

194
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,540
And that's why they'll have
this team of project support

195
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,140
to help them out.

196
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,400
Now, I know we've covered
a lot of different

197
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,390
roles out there.

198
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,930
We talked about the executive,
and the senior user,

199
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,440
and the senior supplier,
and the project manager,

200
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,990
and the team manager,
and the project support,

201
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,670
and the change authority.

202
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,366
All of these roles can have
more than one person assigned

203
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:46,100
to them except the executive.

204
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,508
As you remember, the executive
is the sole person who's

205
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:50,780
overall responsible for the project.

206
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,370
But even the project manager
if you have a really large

207
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,990
project you may have a project
management team of three

208
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,020
or four or five people acting
as the project manager.

209
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,730
Some of these roles can
actually be combined as well.

210
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,040
So, if you're in a small
project you can have

211
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,950
one person who's doing multiple roles.

212
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,940
As I mentioned, your
project manager may also be

213
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,746
your project support, two
different roles being met

214
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,160
by one person.

215
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,470
Now, just like we had the
executive was a role that only

216
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,620
one person can hold, project
assurance is a role that

217
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,140
cannot be combined with other things.

218
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,740
Your project assurance
cannot be combined with your

219
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,920
project manager, your team manager,

220
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,890
or your project support roles.

221
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,650
Because again, the project
assurance is overseeing those

222
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,880
three roles to make sure they're
doing their jobs properly.

223
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,690
If you want to combine project
assurance with something else,

224
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,300
it has to be combined
with either the executive,

225
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,110
the senior user, or the senior
supply role, somebody from

226
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,910
that project board because they

227
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,193
oversee those positions anyway.

228
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,900
Now, when we start talking
about all of this, there are all

229
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,830
of these different roles
and they all have an

230
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,320
interest in this project.

231
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,230
Anyone with an interest
in the project is known

232
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,810
as a stakeholder.

233
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,960
These are people who care
about the project's outcome.

234
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,780
They care about this thing
coming to life, this product.

235
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,860
And all these roles are going to
be considered as stakeholders.

236
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,940
But they're not the only ones,
in fact you have people who

237
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,770
are the end users of your product.

238
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,950
They are stakeholders as well.

239
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,410
You also have other departments
within your organization,

240
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,340
they are going to be stakeholders.

241
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,440
There is really no limit to
who could be a stakeholder

242
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,150
when it comes down to
anyone with an interest

243
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,230
in the project.

244
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,360
The determination of the
project board will be determining

245
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,150
who is a valid stakeholder
that they actually

246
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,430
want to hear from.

247
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,610
So, if I'm building a website,
one of my stakeholders

248
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,940
may be my end customer, but
I may not take the time to

249
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,910
talk to my customer and do
that research and communication

250
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,770
about everything that I'm building.

251
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,590
I may only be keeping that
internal within my organization.

252
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,920
So, some stakeholders will be
consulted and others will not.

253
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,080
It's really up to your
project board who they

254
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,470
want to handle that.

255
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,150
Now, just like we talked about
in business case there were

256
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,880
some documents that had to be created.

257
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,970
There are some documents
that need to be created here

258
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,900
in the organizational theme.

259
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,150
One of those is called the

260
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,490
communication management approach.

261
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,609
This answers the question of
how you're going to communicate

262
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:16,520
with those stakeholders, the ones that you

263
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,060
wish to communicate with.

264
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,420
You're going to have to identify
their information needs.

265
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,660
The method that's going to
be used for communication

266
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,720
is it a meeting, is it a
report, is it an email.

267
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,080
You also have to identify the

268
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,850
frequency of that communication.

269
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,640
Is it going to be daily
or weekly or monthly?

270
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,160
These are all things you have
to determine, and once you do

271
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,310
you write them down
inside your communication

272
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,720
management approach.

273
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,010
For example, your project
board might require a monthly

274
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,180
highlight report from the
project manger, or they may

275
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,880
require a weekly one.

276
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,050
It really depends on how
they want to approach this.

277
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,650
And this communication management
approach will be drafted

278
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,920
up by your project manager and submitted

279
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,779
to the board for approval.

280
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,640
When you look at this
organizational theme we talked about

281
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,210
a lot of roles and responsibilities,
and I want you to see

282
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,180
all on a nice clear chart, which is what

283
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,700
I have here on the screen.

284
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,025
Remember, the project is going
to be approved ultimately by

285
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:12,860
corporate or program management
at the top of the pyramid.

286
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,871
They are going to establish an executive

287
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:17,260
inside the project board.

288
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,610
That project board will
have a senior user,

289
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,800
or more than one.

290
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,910
It'll have an executive only
one, and it'll have a senior

291
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,230
supplier or more than one.

292
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,220
Underneath the project board
the change authority and the

293
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,370
project manager work directly
for the project board.

294
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,871
Underneath the project manager
you have the team managers.

295
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,970
And underneath them you
have the team members.

296
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,790
The project manager may have
project support, which is why

297
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,140
there's a dash line there,
and you have project assurance

298
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,155
it is also a dash line that
would either be overseeing

299
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:50,140
the project management or
that role would be delegated

300
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,020
upward to a senior supplier or senior user

301
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,480
to take on that responsibility.

302
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,810
So, hopefully this helps bring
all of this together in one

303
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,900
nice clean chart for you to see how all

304
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,240
of this coordinates together.

305
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,448
Now, just like we did with
the business case theme,

306
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:07,580
here in the organizational
theme there are a couple of

307
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,760
key things you have to
do to be able to meet the

308
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,150
requirements for it.

309
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,190
The minimum requirements are to define

310
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,910
the organizational structure.

311
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,350
Creating a chart that looks something

312
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,160
like the one I just showed you.

313
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,760
You're going to create it for
your organization and assign

314
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,670
those people into those roles.

315
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,920
You're going to define those
roles and responsibilities,

316
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,220
including role descriptions.

317
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,240
Now, what is a role description?

318
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,760
A role description is a short
document, usually no more

319
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,848
than a page or two that says
what that role or that position

320
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:39,090
is responsible for doing.

321
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,510
In that way when you assign
somebody as the senior user

322
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,490
you give them this document
and say here's what's

323
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,800
expected of you.

324
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,590
And that way they know what
they're going to be expected to do,

325
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,780
and they can say yes
or no to that position.

326
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,320
And the third thing you need
to do is produce two documents,

327
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,380
the first is a project initiation
document, and the second

328
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,730
is a communication management approach.

329
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,560
We'll talk more about the
project initiation document

330
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,570
when we get into processes,
and we talk about

331
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,540
initiating a project, because
it's a much more in depth

332
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,590
document and it's required before you can

333
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,163
start your project up.
