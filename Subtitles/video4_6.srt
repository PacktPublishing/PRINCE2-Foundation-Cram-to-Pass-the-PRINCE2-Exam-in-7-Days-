1
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:03,058
- Controlling a stage.

2
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:04,884
So when we look at controlling a stage,

3
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:07,877
this is the function of
your project manager.

4
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:10,014
This is going to make sure
that we assign the work

5
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:12,514
to be done, we monitor that work,

6
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,920
we deal with issues, we report progress

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,044
back to the project board,
we take corrective actions

8
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:19,818
to ensure the stage remains in tolerance.

9
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,806
All of these things are the things

10
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:24,817
that your project manager
does on a daily basis.

11
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,454
So if we look at this
on the process timeline,

12
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:30,515
you will see that the controlling
a stage is sitting there

13
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:32,269
in the managing level.

14
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:35,760
Managing level is what your
project manager is focused on.

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,604
If you look up to the directing level,

16
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,469
that's what your project
board is focused on.

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,361
If you look down to the delivering level,

18
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:44,880
you'll see that that is
what your team managers

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,833
and team members are focused on

20
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,916
and we'll talk about that more
in managing project delivery.

21
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,936
But right now, we're talking
about controlling a stage

22
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,633
and this happens in every single stage

23
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:59,667
starting with the subsequent
stages and your final stage.

24
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,850
Now, as we look at controlling a stage,

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,594
there are many objectives.

26
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:06,056
The first is to ensure the
project management team

27
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,422
is focused on delivery of the product

28
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:11,136
within the tolerances they were given.

29
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,904
They also want to ensure
that risks and issues

30
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:17,330
are kept under control
and within tolerances.

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,071
You want to ensure that the
business case is being reviewed

32
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,079
to make sure you're delivering a product

33
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,931
that your customer wants,

34
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:26,593
and you want to ensure that
the agreed-upon products

35
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:29,752
are delivered within the cost,
effort and time constraints

36
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:32,824
that you were allotted
by your project board.

37
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,019
Finally, you want to ensure your progress

38
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,959
is being reported to the board
because they're your boss,

39
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,442
they need to know where
you are and you do that

40
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:43,475
through highlight reports
and when bad things happen

41
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:45,386
through exceptional reports.

42
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:47,271
And those have to be escalated up to them

43
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,595
so they can help you get back on track.

44
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:51,711
Now, when we talk about
controlling a stage,

45
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,033
this is where we're going to conduct

46
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:56,081
our day-to-day management
by your project manager.

47
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:59,415
Like I said before, this process is begun

48
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,967
when the project board
approves the project

49
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:04,159
in the initiation stage.

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,747
So once this project gets
started and every time

51
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:09,132
there's a new stage that
needs to be approved,

52
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:12,200
that's where this controlling
a stage starts again.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,019
Once you have an approve stage plan,

54
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,145
you're controlling a stage again.

55
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,173
You're going to focus on product delivery

56
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:20,231
for each stage's products

57
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,959
and any deviations have to be agreed upon

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,439
by the project board
before the stage begins,

59
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,084
and approved inside your
project or your stage plan.

60
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,763
The project manager is going
to assign work as work packages

61
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:37,138
to their team managers to
get the projects delivered.

62
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:39,902
It's very rare that the project manager,

63
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:42,330
especially on a large project is going

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,338
to be delivering products themselves.

65
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,542
Instead, they're going
to be pushing that down

66
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,016
to their team managers
and those team managers

67
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,546
may even have sub teams underneath them.

68
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,280
Now, all of this has to be reported

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,455
and reporting is really crucial.

70
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:59,274
The team managers are going
to send up checkpoint reports

71
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:02,282
to the project manager
with their work status.

72
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,795
It looks a lot like a highlight report.

73
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,351
The project managers then collect all

74
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:09,153
of those progress reports from
all of their different teams

75
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:11,808
and consolidate them
into an executive summary

76
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,805
called the highlight report.

77
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:15,556
Using these checkpoint reports,

78
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,785
the project manager can
monitor the schedule

79
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,389
and make sure there's no slippages

80
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,069
that were falling behind schedule

81
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,281
or if we're getting too
far ahead of schedule.

82
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,992
And any kind of cost overruns
should be identified here.

83
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:30,183
If one is being forecast and
an exception report is required

84
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:32,372
then it's going to be up
to the project manager

85
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:36,268
to submit that exception
report up to the Project Board.

86
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:38,449
Now, once I have an approve stage plan,

87
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:42,494
it's my job as the project
manager to continually update it

88
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:46,475
with the progress that I'm
actually seeing inside the stage

89
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,451
and forecast out the
remainder of my stage.

90
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,576
This helps me know where I am in terms

91
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,284
of budget and schedule.

92
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:56,206
Am I falling behind or am I getting ahead?

93
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:57,984
Project plans and business cases

94
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:01,255
are not updated continuously
during this process though.

95
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,659
Those project plans and
those business cases

96
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,621
are going to be updated in
the managing a stage boundary,

97
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:10,259
and they're going to be
done at the end of the stage

98
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,676
which we talked about in the last lesson.
