1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,680
- Learn from experience.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,500
The next principle we're going to cover is

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,900
learn from experience.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,920
And this is really important
because as the old saying goes,

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,180
experience is the best teacher.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,170
And PRINCE2 understands that.

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,490
So PRINCE2 added this
as one of the principles

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,810
you should build your project on top of.

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,280
And it really asks the question,

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,740
how can we learn from both our
successes and our failures.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,660
Because we learn from both.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,230
When you're successful,
you learn the things

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,440
you should be doing.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,020
And when you fail, you learn the things

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,370
you shouldn't be doing.

16
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,560
But both of them are very useful.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,700
It's important not just
to learn from yourself

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,090
but to learn from others
who have gone before you.

19
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,320
And that's what PRINCE2
really wants to work on,

20
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,200
is capturing that information.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,060
Because it knows that
everyone makes mistakes.

22
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,210
But we need to learn from
them so we don't repeat them.

23
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,270
We do this by collecting
reports of the lessons learned

24
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,830
from previous projects.

25
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,240
So I'm going to start a
new project and I was told

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,640
I need to do a rollout of Windows 10,

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,270
I might pull the lessons learned
from when we did a rollout

28
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,340
of Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 or Windows XP,

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,090
because they're very similar experiences.

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,870
Now maybe one department has
already done the rollout.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,860
So I might learn from them
exactly what they did and

32
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,220
what went right and what went wrong.

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,440
Now as a project manager,
I want to make sure that

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,470
I'm generating reports
during my project as well.

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,960
So I'm capturing those
lessons while they're fresh

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,090
in my mind.

37
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,660
And that way, they could be passed out

38
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,330
to other project managers so
they can learn from as well.

39
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,890
So, whose responsibility is
capturing all these lessons?

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,200
Well, the project manager
should be the one to identify,

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,980
document and disseminate the
lessons via the lessons report

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,350
up to the project board who oversees them.

43
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,810
That project board though,
oversees a lot of projects.

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,380
And so it's their job to
take that information and

45
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,640
pass it down to other project
managers to implement inside

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,910
of their projects.

47
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,180
And so we have this
pyramid and this triangle

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,370
of passing information up,
over and down so that everyone

49
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,570
can learn from each other
as we move through and

50
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,510
do project management.

51
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,700
Now, the big things to remember
is that hindsight is 20/20.

52
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,020
What do i mean by that?

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,760
Well, it's really easy to
look back on a project and go,

54
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,360
man if only we didn't do X,

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,720
we wouldn't have had
this bad thing happen.

56
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,840
Well, it's easy to see
that when you look back.

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,980
But it's hard to figure
it out in the future.

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,470
And so you want to make
sure that you're capturing

59
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,360
these things as they happen
and after they happen.

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,931
So you don't repeat them in the future.

61
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:33,070
The way you do this is by
setting up a lessons learned log

62
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,860
during the starting up a project process,

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,460
which we'll talk about later.

64
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,200
You also want to generate lessons
at the end of each stage and

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,060
pass those lessons reports
up to the project board.

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,220
And then, the final lessons
learned report is going to be

67
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,980
created during your
closing a project process.

68
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,730
Because as you close that
project, you want to capture

69
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,680
anything that happened
during the project as well as

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,220
the process of closing the project itself.

71
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,440
Because sometimes, closing a project has

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,900
just as many problems as doing the project

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,030
during the middle of the cycle.

74
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,630
Now, lessons learned are testable.

75
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,030
What do I mean by that?

76
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,220
Well if your company follows PRINCE2

77
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,740
from an auditing perspective,
and they have assurance

78
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,200
auditors coming in to check
and see if you're compliant

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,350
with PRINCE2, they will ask
for evidence that lessons

80
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,060
are actually being learned
and not just collected.

81
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,100
I've been in a lot of organizations

82
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,410
where we really just call
them lessons observed.

83
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,130
We see this problem in a
project, we write it down and

84
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,140
then we forget about it.

85
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,910
And then we do the project
again, very similar,

86
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,280
and we have the same problems.

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,330
Because we didn't learn our lessons.

88
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,900
So these auditors are going
to be looking for proof

89
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,060
that the things you noted that
were bad have actually been

90
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,460
implemented to improve the process and

91
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,560
prevent mistakes in the future.

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,990
So I want you to remember
that lessons learned

93
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,630
are not the same as lessons observed.

94
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,970
You need to take action.

95
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,070
You need to implement those
changes so you're not repeating

96
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,590
the same issues from the previous project

97
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,640
in your new project.

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,970
You learn from those things,
change and continually improve.

99
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,200
So how do we prevent mistakes?

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,110
Well the first things is we have to learn

101
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,610
from those past mistakes
like we mentioned,

102
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,940
to prevent new ones from occurring.

103
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,270
We also want to create a repository
of these lessons reports.

104
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,230
So as the project manager, I'm
going to turn my report in up

105
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,660
to the project board.

106
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,450
But that's not where it should stop.

107
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,910
They should go into some sort
of an electronic database or

108
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,840
a collection system like a
SharePoint site or other,

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,460
so that other people can
search and find things

110
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,110
about this project that may
relate to their project.

111
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,130
You also want to recruit
member to your project

112
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,250
with similar project experience.

113
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,300
Because there really is no
substitute for experience.

114
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,730
Now I deal with a lot of people trying

115
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,700
to get into the cybersecurity world.

116
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,470
And they get really upset
because they're like,

117
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,530
no one will give me a chance
because I don't have experience

118
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,370
in this job, they won't give me a job

119
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,790
so I can get experience.

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,180
And I get that, it's very frustrating.

121
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,720
But you have to look at
it from their perspective.

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,220
They're trying to minimize
risk in their projects and

123
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,510
in their operations.

124
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,650
And the way that you do that
is by finding qualified people

125
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,570
who have experience and
have done that thing before.

126
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,400
Because if you've done that thing before,

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,090
you're less likely to have mistake

128
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,850
because you know what you're doing.

129
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,520
And that's kind of the idea here.

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,640
If I'm going to go and
put on the Olympic games,

131
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,170
I want to get people who worked

132
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,120
on the last Olympic games right?

133
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,290
If I'm going to go build an
app, I want to get people

134
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,700
who have built apps before, not
somebody who's built houses.

135
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,400
Now some of those skills will transfer

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,930
from project to project.

137
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,160
But a lot of it is based on
the industry you work in.

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,500
And so finding people who have experience

139
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,330
in that type of a thing is very useful and

140
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,840
something you should be looking for

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,463
to help you prevent mistakes.
