1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,750
- Focus on Products

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,620
The Next principle of
PRINCE2 is Focus On Products,

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,970
and this asks the question

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,360
Are we delivering the required quality

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,280
that we've been tasked with?

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,560
Well, when we look at this,

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,090
we want to make sure that we
are successfully delivering

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,300
the products that lead to the benefits

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,170
of the products being realized.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,960
So, if I want to deliver an
app, the app needs to work

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,470
to the approved quality of the end user.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,340
Or if I'm going to build a house,

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,900
I want to make sure the homeowner
is happy with that house.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,650
If I'm building a car, the
car has to do the things

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,680
that we outlined and the
benefits we said it was going to.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,120
This is the idea of Focus On Products,

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,500
so PRINCE2 is all about
focusing on the end product

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,890
and the processes to get you there.

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,390
Now, when we look at that,

20
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,910
this is all about successful delivery.

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,900
The successful delivery of products

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,950
means that the stakeholder's
expectations are met.

23
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,490
Now, who are those stakeholders?

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,220
That was the end user, the supplier,

25
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,700
and the executive, right?

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,610
If those stakeholders are
having their expectations met,

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,020
you hit the bullseye.

28
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,190
We also want to meet
the agreed upon quality,

29
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,040
so if we said we were going to
build a network with 99% uptime,

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,950
and you finish building it after a year

31
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,570
and it's only getting 95% uptime,

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,510
did you get what we agreed upon?

33
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,200
Well, no, so you failed.

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,300
You didn't successfully
deliver the product.

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,450
But if you got it to
99.2, did you meet it?

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,590
Yes, you exceeded my
99% and that was great.

37
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,780
Also, we want to look at

38
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,400
Is this product fit for purpose?

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,030
Does it do what you
said it was going to do?

40
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,270
If you told me you were going
to build an electric car

41
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,800
that got 100 miles to a
charge and you built this car

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,870
and you could only get 75
miles, did it meet the purpose?

43
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,510
Was it fit for purpose?

44
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,920
Well, no, because I needed something

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,640
that did 100 miles, right?

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,890
So you have to make sure
you focus on the end result.

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,360
Even if you made me that electric car

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,230
and it was half the cost that
you told me it would cost,

49
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,820
I'm still not happy 'cause it didn't do

50
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,770
what I wanted it to do.

51
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,240
When we look at this, it's all
about Product-based Planning.

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,370
Other management methods like PMP

53
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,450
focus on an activity-based
planning, or how to to do things.

54
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,710
In PRINCE2, we're focusing on what to do.

55
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,250
We want to identify what
products need to be created,

56
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,250
and this becomes our checklist.

57
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,160
This is going to reduce

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,310
any kind of scope crypt from happening,

59
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,180
it's going to reduce the
likelihood that the user acceptance

60
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,810
doesn't happen and is disputed,

61
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,810
and it's also going to
reduce the likelihood

62
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,150
of users being dissatisfied,
because if the user says,

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,600
I want something that
does X and you deliver X,

64
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,130
they're happy, right?

65
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,990
That's the idea here.

66
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,080
It's all about Product-based Planning

67
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,830
and getting what you need done.

68
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,490
Now, how do you know
what the customer wants?

69
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,940
How do you agree to that?

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,220
Well, you use product descriptions.

71
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,350
This is going to delineate

72
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,740
exactly what the project will deliver.

73
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,570
Think about it like a blueprint.

74
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,730
It's going to contain the
purpose, the composition,

75
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,640
the specifications, the quality criteria,

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,820
the tolerance levels and
the acceptance criteria,

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,340
and this is all the things
we're going to agree on

78
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,470
before the project starts.

79
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,490
It's going to help the
project team to estimate

80
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,330
the amount of resources they
need, the time, the cost,

81
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,320
and what activities need to be done

82
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,350
in order to get the product
to its final delivery

83
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,280
and being accepted by the end customer.

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,420
So if I'm looking at a house example,

85
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,530
you'll look with the architect
about your blueprints,

86
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,760
and you'll say I want
the light switches here,

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,620
I want this type of air conditioning,

88
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,110
I want this type of tile.

89
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,810
You put all that detail into the plan

90
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,330
as a product description.

91
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,620
When you both sign off on it

92
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,300
and he delivers the house
and it has green carpet

93
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,530
and you signed off that
you wanted green carpet,

94
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,440
you can't complain

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,240
because you got what you asked for, right?

96
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,940
But if you put red carpet in

97
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,800
and the description said green carpet,

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,270
you can complain, right?

99
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,560
So that's the idea here
with product descriptions.

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,656
It's making sure that
everyone's on the same page

101
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:55,220
before we go and dig into this project

102
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,220
and start spending lots of time
and lots of resources on it.
