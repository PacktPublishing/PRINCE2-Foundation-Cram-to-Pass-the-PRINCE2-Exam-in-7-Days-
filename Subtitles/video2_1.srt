00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,480
- The seven principles.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,460
So welcome to section two,
where we're going to talk about

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,240
the seven principles of PRINCE2.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,400
Now, what are the seven principles?

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,390
Well, these are the foundational
building blocks of PRINCE2.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,250
PRINCE2 looked back over
30 years, and it looked at

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,420
lots and lots of different projects.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,320
And they asked two basic questions.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,950
They said, why did this project succeed?

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,230
Or why did this project fail?

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,900
And they look at all of those things,

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,280
and they came up with these answers.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,650
And these answers are
the seven principles.

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,770
They found that if you had
these seven principles,

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,970
you were more likely to be
successful in your project.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,610
And if you were missing one
or many of these principles,

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,070
your project was more likely to fail.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,989
This is how they proved
what the best practices were

19
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,040
by going back and doing
lots and lots of research.

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,470
So what are those seven principles?

21
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,530
Well, they're continued
business justification,

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,050
learn from experience,

23
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,170
defined roles and responsibilities,

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,820
manage by stages,

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,218
manage by exception,

26
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:02,930
focus on products,

27
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,598
and tailor to the environment.

28
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,260
If your project has these seven principles

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,806
as its foundation, it is going
to be more likely to succeed.

30
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:13,170
And so we're going to
cover each of these in

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,621
their own lecture inside of this section.

32
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,230
Let's go ahead and get started with

33
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,013
continued business justification.

34
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:21,561
