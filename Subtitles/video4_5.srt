1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,150
- Managing a stage boundary.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,220
So, when we talk about

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,180
the managing a stage boundary process,

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,095
we're talking about how
we're going to enable

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,920
our project manager to
provide the project board

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,420
with sufficient information
to be able to review

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,730
the success of the
current management stage,

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,020
so they can provide
that go, no go decision,

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,030
and approve the next stage plan

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,250
and review the updated project plan,

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,870
confirm that there is still a
valid business justification,

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,750
and that they can accept any
risks that are outstanding.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,460
So, when we look at this
on the process timeline,

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,730
you can see that it happens
inside the initiation stage

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,670
and subsequent stages.

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,780
The only stage it doesn't
happen in is the final stage,

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,270
because instead of managing
the stage boundary,

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,430
we will then close a project,

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,390
so you can see where this lies
inside the process timeline.

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,800
Let's talk a little bit more about

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,690
what managing a stage boundary means.

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,530
So, what are the objectives
of managing a stage boundary?

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,470
Well, really, here we want
to assure project board

24
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,010
that all the products in the current stage

25
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,010
are completed and approved,

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,340
so if I'm developing a piece of software,

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,860
maybe there are 10 products
that are going to be created,

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,260
and we're going to do
three in the first stage,

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,930
two in the second stage, and
three in the final stage.

30
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,930
If I'm coming close to
the end of my first stage,

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,830
I need to go prove to the project board

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,760
that I've finished the
three pieces of software

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,130
for those first three products correctly,

34
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,360
and they've been approved.

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,570
Once I have, they'll give me the go ahead

36
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,680
if they think I still
have a valid business case

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,740
to move into the second stage.

38
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,800
This is going to allow me, also,

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,930
time to prepare for my next stage

40
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,320
by creating the next stage plan.

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,510
I also will review and update
my project initiation document

42
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,110
so that we can see if it's still valid

43
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,150
or if there's any changes
that need to be made,

44
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,960
and we're going to
provide the project board

45
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,120
the information needed to verify

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,570
that we still have a
continued, valid business case

47
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,410
so that we can get that go decision

48
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,080
and move into the next stage.

49
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,490
If we don't have a valid
business case anymore,

50
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,770
then they should make the decision

51
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,280
to close the project early.

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
Some other things that we need to do

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,040
for managing a stage boundary
is to record any lessons

54
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,010
or information that can
help us during later stages

55
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,170
of this project or another future project.

56
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,920
We also want to request authorization

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,324
to begin that next stage, get
that formal go permission,

58
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,760
and then finally, the
other thing we can do

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,340
with managing a stage boundary

60
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,070
is get approval for an exception plan,

61
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,720
because maybe we've gotten
off track with this project,

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,660
but we think there's still
a valid business case,

63
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,480
and we say hey, here's my exception plan.

64
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,370
I can get us back on track.

65
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,170
If you approve my exception,
I can replace the project plan

66
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,230
or replace the stage plan
and get us back on track

67
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,770
and finish this product successfully.

68
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,510
So, all of this comes
down to getting that go,

69
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,590
no go decision from the project board.

70
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,070
The end stage assessment
here is what happens

71
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,450
at the end of this stage.

72
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,050
That's why it's called the
end stage assessment, right?

73
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,910
It happens near the end of the stage,

74
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,940
and the project manager is going to begin

75
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,540
the managing a stage boundary process.

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,650
They're going to make an
assessment of where they are,

77
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,480
what was their forecast,
and what is their actual.

78
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,760
The project manager is going
to meet with the project board

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,135
to conduct this assessment,

80
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:18,608
and they are going to go
over the business case

81
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,080
and the project plan, and
they're going to update those

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,120
and provide the most recent
copies to the project board

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,910
and say here is where we currently sit.

84
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,160
Here is what I think it's going to take

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,920
to get to the next place.

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,340
Do you think we're there?

87
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,540
And the project manager has
to present this information

88
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,950
for the project board
so that they can make

89
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,540
an informed decision on the
viability of this project,

90
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,970
and should it get that go decision,

91
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,690
to proceed into the next stage.

92
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,700
The last thing that we have
to do inside this process

93
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,230
is a lessons report.

94
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,340
Every time we get up
to the end of a stage,

95
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,740
we need a lessons report,

96
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,010
and this is going to be
a report that identifies

97
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,920
any lessons that were identified

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,090
that can help us prevent issues.

99
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,238
These lessons will be incorporated
into the next stage plan

100
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:04,800
or an exception plan,
if we got way off track,

101
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,130
and there are going to be
revision to the quality,

102
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,560
the risk, and the issue
management that may be required

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,250
based on what we've learned.

104
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,060
Maybe we thought that there
was going to be no snow

105
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,680
as we're building this house,

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,840
and there was a big snowstorm
and that took us off track.

107
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,910
Then maybe we need to account
some time in our project

108
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,570
for bad weather days.

109
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,410
This would be a lesson
that we would incorporate

110
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,050
into the next stage plan,

111
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,020
because maybe we're going
into the rainy season,

112
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,110
and that's going to have a work stoppage,

113
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,480
and so you can see what we're doing here.

114
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,530
We're taking these lessons
and incorporating them

115
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,960
back into our stage plan so
our plans get more accurate

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,790
and better and more efficient

117
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,433
as we move through the project.

118
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,889
(light tech buzzing)
