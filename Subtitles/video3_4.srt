1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,310
- Quality. Our third theme is Quality.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,660
When we talk about quality,
this about defining

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,500
and implementing the
mechanisms in the project

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,200
to determine if your products
going to be fit for purpose,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,860
and be able to provide those benefits

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,090
that the customer is expecting.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,260
This asks the question does the product

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,440
meet the agreed upon requirements?

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,550
Because if it doesn't,

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,020
you're not meeting the
quality your customer expects.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,670
Now to do that we come up
with acceptance criteria.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,300
Acceptance criteria is
the measurable definitions

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,210
of attributes of a set of products

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,200
that makes them acceptable
to the key stakeholders.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,750
Now that's a lot of legalese type jargon,

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,180
that really says if you told the customer

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,470
you were going to deliver something

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,350
that went from zero to 60 in three seconds

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,180
and you brought them
something that went zero to 60

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,870
in five seconds, that didn't
meet the acceptance criteria.

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,000
So you have to meet what you promise them.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,830
This is agreed upon before
the project ever begins,

23
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,600
that way everyone knows
what is expected of them

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,540
and what the outcome of
this project is going to be.

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,270
Most customer requirements
though are pretty vague,

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,620
and so you need to work with them

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,720
to make sure that you develop
good acceptance criteria.

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,457
When I used to build websites
I used to hear all the time

29
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,060
"I want things, I want it
faster, I want it cheaper,

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,760
I want it more user friendly."

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,220
What does that really mean?

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,620
So when they want something
that says "I want it faster,"

33
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,020
I would say "Okay, we want
to make sure your load time

34
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,150
is less than two seconds."

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,420
I want it cheaper. Okay,
it's currently costing you

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,940
a hundred thousand dollars a year,

37
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,870
we're going to build you something

38
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,550
that's only going to
cost you $80,000 a year.

39
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,214
And if we can meet those
metrics, they're measurable,

40
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:38,640
it takes all the guesswork out of it,

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,500
and the acceptance goes much easier

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,160
at the end of the project.

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,640
You want to make sure you
document this acceptance criteria

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,180
in your high-level requirements documents.

45
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,440
So everyone, before the
project is initiated,

46
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,830
signs off on it and knows
what they're agreeing to.

47
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,380
You want to describe
this in measurable terms,

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,490
and so know what the
product can be delivering,

49
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,350
and make sure that at the
end we can meet those things.

50
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,410
Because if at any time
we think we can't meet

51
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,940
that end acceptance criteria,
the project could be canceled.

52
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,100
Which is okay, sometimes it's a good idea

53
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,470
to cancel a project and
start it again later,

54
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,910
or just pivot to a different direction.

55
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,040
Now when we're talking
about the Quality Theme,

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
you've got to consider what is going to be

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,530
your Quality Management Approach.

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,520
Your Quality Management
Approach is going to help you

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,230
to document the method of quality control

60
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,720
that you're going to
use inside your project.

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,920
The Project Manager is
ultimately responsible

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,380
for quality planning,

63
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,000
and he's document this
inside the Quality Register.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,450
All along the way he's going
to be doing quality checks

65
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,580
to make sure the project is on track

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,740
and meeting the things it's supposed to.

67
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,280
Now the organization is going to have

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,770
a Quality Management System that contains

69
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,980
your quality policies,
procedures, and standards

70
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,680
expected within your organization.

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,000
And that's going to apply
across all projects.

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,520
Quality Assurance is
an organizational role.

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,100
It's somebody outside of your project.

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,950
And they are going to be
looking at your project

75
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,840
and everyone else's projects

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,630
to make sure that they are following

77
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,470
the Quality Management System.

78
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,640
They're going to make sure
those projects are in compliance

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,200
with the organizational policies,
procedures, and processes

80
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,350
to make sure that it
can pass quality audits.

81
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,060
So when we look at Quality Assurance,

82
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,610
it sounds a whole lot like
the Project Assurance role

83
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,840
we talked about in the
Organizational Theme,

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,570
but it's not, they are
two separate things.

85
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,390
Quality Assurance role is
external to your project,

86
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,620
it's somebody in the organization

87
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,560
not inside your Project
Board or Project Team.

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,270
Their main function is to
assure corporate management

89
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,440
or the program level board
that your project is complying

90
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,720
with corporate standards,
policies, and procedures.

91
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,950
The Project Assurance role,
the one we talked about

92
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,550
in the last lesson in
Organizational Theme,

93
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,430
is internal to your project.

94
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,340
It's somebody that's
assuring the Project Board,

95
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,940
that senior user, senior
supplier, and the executive,

96
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,690
that your project is
being conducted properly.

97
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,980
So you can see this
internal versus external.

98
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,360
Again, lots of checks and balances

99
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,850
throughout this project management,

100
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,610
because we're talking about large projects

101
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,230
that cost lots of money.

102
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,480
We want to make sure
that if we're spending

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,150
a million dollars on our project,

104
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,260
it's going the way we want

105
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,780
and it's providing the right quality

106
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,030
that our organization expects.

107
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,520
Now when we look at Quality Assurance

108
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,490
we also look at what's
called Quality Control.

109
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,430
Quality Assurance is focused on how

110
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,340
the processes actually
work, not the end product.

111
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,430
Quality Control is more
focused on the end product.

112
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,610
They want to verify that
the product you build

113
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,170
is fit for purpose.

114
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,000
So if I'm building a car,

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,970
Quality Assurance says my
procedures to build the car

116
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,490
are of high quality, they're working well.

117
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,830
Quality Control says
that the air conditioning

118
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,260
actually works, the radio
turns on, the car starts up,

119
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,010
and that the tires aren't flat.

120
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,620
You can see the difference there.

121
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,020
Now Quality Control is
also going to maintain

122
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,200
your quality and assurance records,

123
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,360
and they're going to help you gain

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,730
the acceptance of your product

125
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,220
at the end, by the end customer.

126
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,150
Because again, if the thing
is not fit for purpose,

127
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,420
your customer doesn't want to accept it,

128
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,410
and then you're stuck holding the bag.

129
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,550
So you got to make sure you
work through these things

130
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,203
and keep your quality high.

131
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,760
Now your Quality Records are
going to be these documentation

132
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,520
of your quality tests.

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,010
They're going to contain all the details

134
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,150
of the results of these quality tests.

135
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,360
Your product is judged
based on its ability

136
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,900
to be fit for purpose, based
on these quality tests.

137
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,630
Now how many tests do you need?

138
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,970
Well, that's up to your project manager.

139
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,130
They are going to build that
into their quality plan,

140
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,540
and based on this fit for purpose testing

141
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,770
the product is then going
to get approved or not,

142
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,610
and if it is an approval
record will be created.

143
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,450
Now what is an approval record?

144
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,300
Well it's just a formal
or informal document

145
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,290
saying that this product met
the level of quality required.

146
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,520
That may take the form
of a printed document

147
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,890
with formal signatures or
it could just be an email

148
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,610
from one boss to another
saying we accept it,

149
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,610
we take ownership now, we agree that

150
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,420
it passes the quality test.

151
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,490
So this really depends
on your organization

152
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,040
and the level of project.

153
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,440
Smaller projects will have informal,

154
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,690
larger projects will have formal.

155
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,790
That just depends on the way

156
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,890
your organization sets it up though.

157
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,850
Next we have the baseline.

158
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,380
And once you approve a product,

159
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,380
it becomes your baseline,
effectively version 1.0.

160
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,300
Now at this point, once
we've created version 1.0,

161
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,180
everything else becomes a change

162
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,800
that has to go through the
change management process,

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,670
and it's going to go through
change control and versioning.

164
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,700
Users will submit what's called an RFC,

165
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,330
or a Request for Change, and
that way it can get approved

166
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,570
and funding can be applied

167
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,950
to make any changes or alterations.

168
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,670
Again, very common in the software world,

169
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,410
you may think it's not as
common in the physical world,

170
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,600
but it really is.

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,820
You look at a car, there's a version one,

172
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,730
and there may be a version 1.1

173
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,790
because they found out that
an airbag wasn't quite right

174
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,930
and they wanted to change those out

175
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,250
with a different product.

176
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,840
Or if you have a house,
they build the whole house

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,410
and go you know what I think that pantry

178
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,150
could've been three feet bigger,

179
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,850
and they can tear down a wall
and move the wall three feet,

180
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,420
and now you've got a bigger pantry.

181
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,990
You're now at version 1.1 of your house.

182
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,730
That's the idea, it's any
changes to these baselines

183
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,570
for this product once
it has been approved.

184
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,220
Now we talked about what happens

185
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,030
when quality is approved
and you pass your test,

186
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,200
but what if you fail your test?

187
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,120
What if your product is not
considered fit for purpose?

188
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,750
Well then the supplier has to
continue to build the product

189
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,050
until they can meet the
level of quality required.

190
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,700
The product is not going to be accepted

191
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,600
until it meets that level of quality

192
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,500
that was agreed upon all the
way back at the beginning

193
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,740
based on our acceptance criteria.

194
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,980
Now what do you do if you can't reach

195
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,930
that level of quality that's needed?

196
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,810
Maybe we agreed that our iPhone
should be able to be dropped

197
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,440
from a two foot distance from the floor

198
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
without cracking the screen.

199
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,830
And we go to do our test and we find

200
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,600
that we just can't make that happen.

201
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,220
We would need new glass,
or a new technology

202
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,840
that just doesn't exist yet.

203
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,850
Well, we can go back to the project board

204
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,240
and say we can't meet the requirements.

205
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,220
Either we need you to
change the requirements,

206
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,640
and change it from two feet to one feet,

207
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,820
or we are going to have
to stop the project

208
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,460
'cause we're just never
going to get there.

209
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,110
And that will be a determination
that the project board

210
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,990
and program management or
corporate management can make.

211
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,700
They can make the
requirements less stringent,

212
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,930
making it go from two feet to one feet,

213
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,530
or they can give you more money

214
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,610
and say "What if I give you
another million dollars,

215
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,560
can you make the technology then?"

216
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,760
Maybe you could.

217
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,670
Or they could say "You
know what, if you can't

218
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,150
meet two feet, forget it,
the whole project's off."

219
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,140
And they will terminate the project early.

220
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,630
Those are your three options.

221
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,890
You either throw more
money at the problem,

222
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,390
you make it less of a specification,

223
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,623
or you just stop the project completely.

224
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,660
Now all of these things
have to be documented.

225
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,780
And when you pass an acceptance test,

226
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,640
you're going to put that
into an acceptance record.

227
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,690
That record is the formal acceptance

228
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,380
of the final product by
different stakeholders.

229
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,150
This will be formal, it
will be in the project

230
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,650
as we go through all of
the acceptance criteria

231
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,630
and verify that we've met them.

232
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,040
All of your acceptance
methods should be determined

233
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,120
before your project begins,

234
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,540
so we all know what the
finish line looks like,

235
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,370
and it's documented inside your
Quality Management Approach.

236
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,690
Now, as far as PRINCE2 is concerned,

237
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,910
there are a couple of
things you have to do

238
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,660
at a minimum to be able to
check off your Quality Theme.

239
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,190
So the first thing you have to do

240
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,427
is define your Quality
Management Approach,

241
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,510
and that's going to cover
your quality control

242
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,120
and your project assurance.

243
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,640
Remember, quality control
and project assurance

244
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,980
happen inside the project.

245
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,940
Quality assurance happens
outside the project.

246
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,580
You also need to make sure you define

247
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,650
your roles and responsibilities,

248
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,160
like who is doing your project assurance,

249
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,640
who is going to do your quality assurance,

250
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,270
and what are the
responsibilities for those.

251
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,270
You also need to create Quality Records

252
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,480
and a Quality Register, which is the way

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
you document quality
throughout the project.

254
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
You're also going to
make sure your customer

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,640
has quality expectations
and acceptance criteria

256
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,780
defined in your product descriptions

257
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,560
before you initiate this
project and move forward,

258
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,430
because I can't start building the things

259
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,760
if I don't know what I'm building towards.

260
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,290
And finally, you should
look back at other projects

261
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,630
and look at the lessons that they learned,

262
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,410
and so you can incorporate those
into your quality planning.

263
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,500
Because if I built a phone before,

264
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,900
and I couldn't meet a two
foot drop requirement,

265
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,330
I need to figure out that, maybe,

266
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,880
that requirement needs to be less,

267
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,370
before I start going down
that road trying to meet it,

268
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,600
or I may need to find new technologies.

269
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,500
Those lessons learned
are going to be critical

270
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,860
to helping you maintain
a high level of quality

271
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,373
and meet those requirements.
