00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,390
- In this short video,
I'm going to show you

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,950
how you can sign up and schedule

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,180
your PRINCE2 Foundation exam.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,200
The first step is you're
going to go to peoplecert.org.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,150
This is the official testing
center and it's done online

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,920
from the comfort of your own home.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,660
To take the exam online,
you have to have a computer,

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,660
an internet connection, a
webcam, and a microphone,

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,470
so the online proctor can see you

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,020
and hear you during the exam.

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,800
Once you go to peoplecert.org,

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
you're going to scroll down
and you're going to find

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,823
where it says PRINCE2.

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,120
Once the PRINCE2 Foundation page loads,

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,630
you're going to be able to
see the price for the exam.

16
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,530
Now this price does go
by regional pricing.

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,450
Depending on where you live in the world,

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,270
you're going to see a different price.

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,900
In the United States, that
price at retail is $349.

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,550
Now, again, depending
where you are in the world

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,950
that may be a little bit
less, but it usually is

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,690
somewhere between about 315 to $350.

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,330
Now you can go ahead and
schedule your exam right here,

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,110
or you can save a little bit of money

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,310
by taking one extra step.

26
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,190
You can go to diontraining.com

27
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,180
and on the front of our homepage
you'll see the Exam button.

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,860
If you click on that Exam button,

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,200
what you're going to see is all
of our exam vouchers for sale.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,650

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,140

32
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,340
you can go and get your

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,600
As you can see on the screen,

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,010
the current price for
this voucher is $299,

35
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,070
a $50 savings off buying
it through PeopleCert.

36
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,950
Now when you buy it from
us, we're going to collect

where you'll receive a one time use code.

40
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,890
Once you have that one time
use code in your email,

41
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,880
you're going to go and
click and create an account

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,190
by going to the little icon and going down

43
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,710
to Create an account if
you're new to PeopleCert.

44
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,980
If you've taken an ITIL exam
or a PRINCE2 exam before,

45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,080
you'll actually have an account

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
and you'll just sign into your account.

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,930
Once you go here, you're going to go ahead

48
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,870
and enter your information.

49
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,670
So I'm going to put in Jason Dion.

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,670
My email address will be
youremail@youremail.com.

51
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,780
Again, you'll enter in
your own information here.

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,690
And then you'll select
your country of residence,

53
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,460
mine is the United States,

54
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,400
and then you'll give it a password.

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,950
And you're going to agree to
those terms and conditions

56
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,080
for the privacy and if you'd
like to receive marketing

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,300
from PeopleCert, you
can check that as well.

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,450
Once you do that, click
on Join PeopleCert.

59
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,780
Now that you're logged in
to your PeopleCert account,

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,520
and you have your exam voucher,

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,870
you can go and enter

62
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,510

63
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,510
Once you do that, it will bring
up a date and time calendar

64
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,040
for you to select the day and time

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,900
that works best for your schedule.

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,150
Once you select that, it'll
show up here under My Exams

67
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,190

68
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,740

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,035
